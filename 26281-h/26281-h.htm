<p><i class="first-word">appy Thought.</i>&mdash;To get
a country house for
the winter. To fill
it with friends. To
have one wing for
bachelors. Another
wing for maidens
with <i>chaperons</i>. To have the <i>Nave</i>, as it
were, of the house, for the married people.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll tell you what you ought to do,&#8221; says Cazell to me.
&#8220;You ought to build a nice little snuggery in the country.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2">2</a></span>
I object to the cost.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cost? Bah! that's nothing. You can always get a
Building Society,&#8221; says he, enthusiastically, &#8220;to advance you
<i>any</i> sum.&#8221;</p>

<p>I ask how these Building Societies proceed.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 136px;">
<img src="images/p0002-image.png" width="136" height="273" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">CAZELL.</span>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Simply enough,&#8221; says
Cazell, who invariably knows
everything about anything,
only if you act on his information
and go wrong, he
generally denies warmly afterwards
that &#8220;he ever said
such a thing.&#8221; &#8220;Simply
enough,&#8221; he continues. &#8220;You
go to the Society, you give
'em some security,&mdash;any security
will do, and you could get
<i>that</i> easily enough.&#8221; I nod
cheerfully, more to encourage
him to proceed, than from
any feeling of certainty as to
the means of obtaining the security. Then, having, satisfactorily
to himself, disposed of this difficulty, he continues:&mdash;&#8220;Well,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3">3</a></span>your security in this case would be your title-deeds of the house
and land.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Title-deeds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; he goes on, as if he'd been accustomed to do this
sort of thing every day, &#8220;you say how much you want. Then
they ask you&#8221; (it's becoming quite dramatic), &#8220;where's your
house? You say .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wherever it is, you know.&#8221; Cazell
puts it in this way, as impressing upon me that before the
Building Society I <i>must</i> tell the truth and not pretend to
them that my house is in Bedfordshire, for example, when it
isn't. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he resumes, &#8220;then they ask you what sort of a
house do you intend to build? Then, you lay your plan before
them.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;The Plan of my House.</p>

<p>&#8220;They examine it, that is, their architect does .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they
inquire about the land .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and then they decide, whether
they'll buy it for you, or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>(&#8220;<i>Not</i>&#8221; I should think, but I don't say so.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; he goes on. &#8220;You make the purchase, and hand
over the title-deeds. Pay them a rent and a per-centage
every year until the whole is paid off, when it becomes
yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In fact,&#8221; I put it, bluffly, to him, &#8220;I can build a house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4">4</a></span>without having any money; I mean, by getting the money
from the Building Society?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely. Any day.&#8221;</p>

<p>I hesitate. It really is&mdash;if Cazell is correct&mdash;much better
than hiring a house .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or taking lodgings. And what does
Cazell think the cost will be?</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; says he, &#8220;put it at &pound;2,000, the outside.&#8221; I reflect
that the inside, too, will be a considerable expense. &#8220;A good,
strong house. Why, I knew a fellow build one for &pound;1,500.
Just what you want. Then, there's the ground&mdash;say at another
two. And there you are. Four thousand altogether. Well,
you'd pay 'em a mere rent for that, and so much tacked on,
which would, each time, reduce the principal. And when you
pay your last year of rent and interest, it ought to have come
down to a five-pound note.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is admirable. What a glorious society is the Building
Society .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>if</i> Cazell is only right.</p>

<p>I will draw out plans at once.</p>

<p>Will he come down with me, somewhere, and choose the
land?</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. Why not try Kent?&#8221; he asks. I have no
objection to Kent. &#8220;But,&#8221; I suggest, &#8220;wouldn't it be better,
first, to settle the sort of thing wanted?&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;&#8220;While I <i>am</i>
about it&#8221; (as Milburd says), &#8220;why
not a Turkish bath?&#8221; In the house.
Excellent!</p>

<p>What after this?</p>

<p>Milburd suggests smoking-room,
and library. Yes. That's all.</p>

<p>Not <i>all</i>: Milburd thinks that a
Racquet Court wouldn't be bad, and <i>while I am about it</i>, it
would be scarcely any more expense, to have a Tennis Court;
and, by the way, a positive saving to utilise the outside walls
of both, for Fives.</p>

<p><i>Query.</i> Won't this cost too much?</p>

<p>&#8220;The question is,&#8221; says Boodels (he has been recently
improving his own house), &#8220;What is your limit?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I argue, let's see what an imaginary house will cost,
and then <i>I'll have so much of it as I want</i>. Say,&#8221; I put
it, &#8220;a house is to cost two thousand&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6">6</a></span>
&#8220;Can't be done for the money,&#8221; says Boodels, positively.</p>

<p>This is rather damping, but, on consideration, it's just what
Boodels <i>would</i> say in anybody's case, except his own.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 117px;">

<span class="caption">BOODELS OF BOODELS.</span>
</div>

<p>I pass over his opinion and
continue.</p>

<p>&#8220;For argument's sake, let's
say the house costs four thousand&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
(This I feel sounds
very pleasant, but what will the
Building Society say, and how
about the security? These,
however, are details for subsequent
consideration. One thing
at a time: and these extras
rather hamper one's ideas. So
I say &pound;4,000, and leave it at
that.)</p>

<p>&#8220;More,&#8221; says Boodels, &#8220;but
you <i>might</i> do it for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>I repeat &#8220;For argument's sake.&#8221; Formula admitted.</p>

<p>Well then, I suppose it to cost four thousand, I can only
spend two thousand. Very good, I'll only have, as it were,
two thousand pounds' worth of house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7">7</a></span>
&#8220;Half a house, in fact,&#8221; says Milburd.</p>

<p>This is not the way to put it, but I am, I feel, right, somehow.</p>

<p>I appeal to my friend Jenkyns Soames, who is writing a book
on Scientific Economy.</p>

<p>He replies that mine is correct, in theory, if taken from a
certain point of view. We admit that this is a sensible way of
putting it. And are, generally, satisfied.</p>

<p>&#8220;There's one thing I <i>must</i> have,&#8221; I remember, aloud, as I sit
down to draw a first plan, &#8220;my Study.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8">8</a></span>
&#8220;How about your staircases,&#8221; says Boodels, &#8220;and your
kitchen, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>I observe that this is only a commencement. That my
object is to remember everything gradually, and so omit
nothing.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Only one floor and one flight of
stairs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 359px;">

</div>

<p>Here I find the library has been forgotten.</p>

<p>Add on the library in dots; like a railway map.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you get there from the study?&#8221; asks Milburd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, by doors, through the dining-room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Awkward,&#8221; suggests Boodels.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I don't think so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you light your study?&#8221; asks Cazell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9">9</a></span>
&#8220;Eh?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ah!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;From above.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; says Milburd, as if there was an end of the whole
thing, &#8220;you lose a bed-room by that, and another over the
billiard-room.&#8221;</p>

<p>True.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Bring study more forward and light it by
big window in front. (I do so in dots.)</p>

<p>Milburd says: &#8220;Throw out a bay.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is his invariable resource.</p>

<p>I throw out a bay-window (also in dots) and then we survey
it carefully.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;To have an In-door Amusement Hall for
Wet Weather.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will your Amusement hall be <i>the</i> Hall?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the front door will be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.?&#8221;</p>

<p>I indicate in dots the front door, and the drive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely,&#8221; says Boodels, &#8220;and just as you're in the
middle of a game of something, up comes a party to call;
you can't say you're not at home, and the servants can't
open the door while the ball, or whatever it is, is flying
about.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10">10</a></span>
True .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. bring it more forward. Or make a
new plan.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 363px;">
<img src="images/p0010-image.png" width="363" height="204" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>&#8220;Then the bath-room's forgotten,&#8221; says Milburd. Add it in
dots to tennis court.</p>

<p>Then over every room there'll be a bed-room and dressing-room.
So that'll be a good house.</p>

<p>&#8220;What style?&#8221; asks Cazell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Elizabethan, decidedly,&#8221; I reply. They think not.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gothic's useful,&#8221; says Boodels.</p>

<p>&#8220;Italian's better,&#8221; observes Milburd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something between the two,&#8221; suggests Cazell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11">11</a></span>
Twelve rooms below, twelve above. Stables outside, added
subsequently.</p>

friend.</p>

<p>I say, Estimate it roughly.</p>

<p>He does it, after a day or
so.</p>

<p><i>Rough Estimate.</i> About
&pound;8,000.</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; I say, a little
staggered, &#8220;is rather <i>over</i>
the mark than under it,
eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Over?</i> No,&#8221; he replies,
&#8220;<i>Under.</i> I mean, of
course, to have everything
done well, thoroughly well.
Of course,&#8221; says he, &#8220;there
are men who will run you
up a house in a few weeks and charge you about &pound;4,000. But
what's the result? Why you're always repairing, and it costs
you, in the end, double what you'd have paid for having it
thoroughly well done at first.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12">12</a></span>
I ask how long the building would take? Chilvern is of
opinion that it would be six months at the least.</p>

<p>Then I say I'll give it up. I wanted it for Christmas.</p>

<p>Then the notion of the party must be abandoned.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;An abandoned party! Dreadful character.</p>

<p>Boodels says he's sorry for that, as he can't go into his own
house just now, it being under repair.</p>

<p>Cazell suddenly exclaims, &#8220;I tell you what we ought to do!&#8221;
We listen. He goes on. &#8220;We ought to take a house for the
Winter Season, the lot of us together, and then ask our own
friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boodels observes, that, if we agree to this, he will supply
some servants, as <i>his</i> are doing nothing. Chilvern can tell us
where there's a place to be let. Just what we want, about
an hour's train from town. Queer old mansion, a bit out of
trim, he tells us, in fact he was going to have had the job of
restoring it, only the people suddenly left; but he'd put that to
rights. Would we go and look at it?</p>

that there is no Guide to this county.
Black ignores it, Murray knows nothing
about it, and Bradshaw is silent on the
subject.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;While at Our Mansion
write a Guide to Hertfordshire.</p>

<p>Arrived at the station we inquire for
Blackmeer Hall. Six or seven miles to
drive. I ask if this distance isn't against it? I am met by
the unanimous answer, &#8220;Not at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chilvern points out the beauties of the road as we go along.
We become silent, not liking to have things perpetually pushed
under our notice, as if we couldn't see them for ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14">14</a></span>
&#8220;There's a fine bit,&#8221; he says, pointing to a gate. We nod.
&#8220;Aren't the colours of the trees lovely?&#8221; he asks. We agree
with him. For the sake of argument, I observe that I've seen
finer. &#8220;Where?&#8221; he inquires. I don't know at this moment
<i>where</i>, but, being on my mettle, I am certain that I <i>have</i> seen
finer.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;In Derbyshire.</p>

<p>He pooh-poohs the notion of Derbyshire. Then he continues
giving us bits of useful information, like a disjointed
lecture.</p>

<p>&#8220;There's a tree for you!&#8221; he exclaims. Then, &#8220;There's a
queer old roof, eh?&#8221; No notice being taken of this, he continues,
&#8220;Fine beech that!&#8221; &#8220;Beautiful view, isn't it?&#8221;
Presently, &#8220;Just look at the sky <i>now</i>!&#8221; and so on.</p>

<p>Cazell begins to resent it, so does Boodels.</p>

<p>Chilvern says, pointing left and right, &#8220;Ah, these fields are
the place for mushrooms.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boodels says that his own fields in Essex are better.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not better than this,&#8221; says Chilvern.</p>

<p>Boodels returns that they are, and that <i>he</i>, Boodels, <i>ought</i> to
know.</p>

<p>Chilvern pauses to allow the subject to stand and cool, as it
were; then he begins again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15">15</a></span>
&#8220;That's a fine cow there. This is a great place for cows.
It's where all the celebrated cheeses are made.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, my dear fellow,&#8221; cries Boodels, &#8220;you should see the
cows in Gloucestershire. They <i>are</i> cows.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cazell agrees with him, but caps it with, &#8220;Yes, but I'll tell
you what <i>you</i> ought to do,&#8221; to Chilvern: &#8220;you ought to go to
the Scilly Islands, and see the cows there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Milburd says if it's a question of going to islands, why not to
the Isle of Wight and see Cowes there? I laugh, slightly; as
it doesn't do to encourage Milburd too much. The others, who
are warming with their conversation, treat the joke with silent
contempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;There's a larch for you,&#8221; cries Chilvern, in admiration of a
gigantic fir-tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;That!&#8221; exclaims Cazell. &#8220;My dear fellow&#8221;&mdash;whenever he
is getting nettled in discussion, he always becomes excessively
affectionate in his terms&mdash;&#8220;My dear fellow, you ought to go to
Surrey to see the larches, and the firs.&#8221; Boodels observes in a
chilly sort of way that he doesn't care for larches, <i>or</i> firs.</p>

<p>In order to divert the stream of their conversation, I remark
that I have no doubt there's some capital trout fishing about
here. I say this on crossing a bridge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; says Chilvern, &#8220;see the trout in Somersetshire. My!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16">16</a></span>Why in some places you could catch twenty, with as many flies,
all at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cazell tops this without a pause; he says, &#8220;Ah! if you want
trout you should go to Shropshire. I <i>never</i> saw such a place
for trout. You've only got to put your hand down, and you
can take them asleep in the ditches.&#8221;</p>

<p>Milburd exclaims incredulously, &#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; meaning, &#8220;Oh
no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear boy,&#8221; says Cazell, emphatically, &#8220;I assure you it's a
known thing. Tell a Shropshire man about trout in any other
county, and he'll laugh in your face.&#8221;</p>

<p>Except for politeness, we feel, all of us, a strong inclination to
act like the ideal Shropshire man, under the present circumstances.</p>

<p>We enter an avenue.</p>

<p>The driver tells us we are approaching the house. We pass
a large pond partially concealed by trees. In the centre there
is an island with a sort of small ruined castle on it. It is, as it
were, a Castle for One.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Sort of place where a Hermit could play
Solitaire. And get excited over it. Who invented Solitaire?
If it was a Hermit, why didn't the eminent ascetic continue
the idea and write a book of games?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17">17</a></span>
<i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;To call it &#8220;Games for Hermits.&#8221;</p>

<p>Milburd exclaims, &#8220;Stunning place for fireworks. We might
do the storming of the Fortress there.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;&#8220;Good place,&#8221; say, &#8220;for a retired
study.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cazell says, &#8220;I tell you what we ought to do with that;
make it into spare rooms. A castle for single gentlemen.
They could cross in a boat at night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chilvern is of opinion it ought to be restored, and made a
gem of architectural design.</p>

<p>Boodels says, if anything, he should like it to be an observatory,
or, on second thoughts, a large aquarium.</p>

<p>Cazell says at once, &#8220;If you want to see an aquarium you
should go to Havre.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chilvern returns that there's a better one at Boulogne.</p>

<p>Milburd caps this by quoting the one at the Crystal
Palace.</p>

<p>Cazell observes quickly that <i>the</i> place for curious marine
specimens is Bakstorf in Central Russia.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You've</i> never been to Central Russia,&#8221; says Milburd,
superciliously. Professing to have travelled considerably
himself, he doesn't like the idea of anyone having done the
same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18">18</a></span>
&#8220;I wish,&#8221; exclaims Cazell, using a formula of his own,
&#8220;I wish I had as many sovereigns as I've been in Central
Russia.&#8221;</p>

<p>This appears conclusive, and, if it isn't, here we are at the
House. Blackmeer Hall. Elizabethan, apparently.</p>

<p><span class="first-word">n</span> old woman curtseys, and ushers
our party into the Hall itself,
which is lofty and spacious,
but in a mildewy condition.</p>

<p>The floor is partly stone
partly tiles, as if the original
designer had been, in his day, uncertain whether to make a
roof of it, or not.</p>

<p>A fine old chimney, with a hearth for logs, and dogs, is at one
end, and reminds me of retainers, deer hounds, oxen roasted
whole, and Christmas revels in the olden time.</p>

<p>The windows are diamond-paned. To open in compartments.</p>

<p>The old woman tells us that this was rebuilt in fifteen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20">20</a></span>hundred and fifty-two, and then she shows us into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>This is a fine apartment with an Oriel window, giving on to
a lawn of rank and tangled grass. Beyond this chaos of
green, is a well timbered covert, dense as a small black
forest.</p>

<p>The distance between the trees becoming greater to the left
of the plantation, we obtain a glimpse of the lake which we
passed on our road.</p>

<p>There is another grand fire-place in this room. The wainscot
wants patching up, and so does the parqueted floor.</p>

<p>The old woman tells us that &#8220;they say as Queen Elizabeth
was once here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Milburd asks seriously, &#8220;Do you recollect her, ma'am?&#8221;</p>

<p>The crone wags her head and replies &#8220;that it was afore
her time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mentioning the word Crone to Boodels, I ask him what
relation it bears to &#8216;Cronie.&#8217; &#8220;&#8216;Cronie,&#8217; almost obsolete now,
means &#8216;a familiar friend,&#8217;&#8221; I explain to him. He says thank
you, and supposes that the two words have nothing in common
except sound.</p>

<p>The notion being in fact part of my scheme for <i>Typical Developments</i>
(Vol. XIII. Part I. &#8220;<i>On sounds of words and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21">21</a></span>their relation to one another</i>&#8221;), I offer him my idea on the
subject.</p>

<p>He asks, &#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;&#8220;Crone&#8221; is the feminine of &#8220;Cronie.&#8221;
&#8220;Cronie&#8221; is an old friend, &#8220;Crone&#8221; is an old friend's old wife.
Which sounds like a sentence in one of my German Exercises.
&#8220;The Old wife of the Old friend met the Lion in the
garden.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boodels says &#8220;Pooh!&#8221; If he doesn't understand a thing at
once he dismisses it with &#8220;pooh.&#8221; As I ascend the wide oak
staircase, with room enough for eight people abreast on every
step, I reflect on the foolishness of a man saying &#8220;pooh,&#8221;
hastily. How many great schemes might anyone nip in the
bud by one &#8220;pooh.&#8221; What marvellous inventions, apparently
ridiculous in their commencing idea, would be at once knocked
on the head by a single &#8220;pooh.&#8221; The rising Artist has an infant
design for some immense historical Fresco. He comes&mdash;I see
him, as it were, coming to Boodels to confide in him. &#8220;I
mean,&#8221; says he, &#8220;to show Peter the Great in the right-hand
corner, and Peter the Hermit in another, with Peter Martyr
somewhere else, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in fact, I see an immense historical
subject of all the Celebrated Peters .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then why not
offer it to St. Peter's at Rome, and why not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.?&#8221; &#8220;Pooh!&#8221;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22">22</a></span>says Boodels, and the artist perhaps goes off and drowns himself,
or goes into business and so is lost to the World. If I'd
listened to Boodels' &#8220;Pooh,&#8221; I should never have got on so far
as I have with my work on Typical Developments. I hope to
be remembered by this.</p>

<p>Milburd is calling me. Everyone in ecstasies. What wonderful
old chambers. Oak panels, diamond panes. Remains
of tapestry, containing probably a fine collection of moths. Old
rusty armour on the walls. Strange out-of-the-way staircases
leading to postern-doors and offices.</p>

<p>Chilvern observes that it all wants doing up, and commences
making plans and notes in a book, which he takes from his
pocket, in company with a small ivory two-foot rule.</p>

<p>&#8220;Plenty of mice,&#8221; says Cazell, looking at the old woman for
corroboration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, in winter-time,&#8221; she says.</p>

<p>&#8220;And rats?&#8221; inquires Milburd.</p>

<p>&#8220;I've met 'em on the stairs,&#8221; replies the old lady, quite
cheerfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ghosts, too?&#8221; suggests Boodels. [He has become somewhat
melancholy of late and says that he is studying the
phenomena of &#8220;Unconscious Cerebration,&#8221; which Milburd
explains is only a name for thinking of nothing without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23">23</a></span>knowing it. Boodels, in consequence, thinks Milburd a mere
buffoon.]</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my husband,&#8221; she answers in a matter-of-fact way,
&#8220;my husband, he see the Ghost.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think it were last Christmas
twelvemonth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>The</i> Ghost!&#8221; exclaims Boodels, much interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, the White Lady,&#8221; says the old woman as pleasantly
as possible. &#8220;There's the marks on the floor of the stain
where she was murdered. There! that gentleman's standing
on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Good gracious! so I am. A dull sort of mulberry-coloured
stain. &#8220;It won't wash out,&#8221; she goes on. &#8220;I've tried it. And
it won't plane out, as they've tried <i>that</i>. And so,&#8221; she finishes
with a sniff, &#8220;there it is.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="first-word">very</span> one is silent for a minute, and then
we smile at the absurd idea of there
being a ghost about. I linger for a few
seconds after the others. They go out
on to the landing. When I leave the
room I pass out there too. They are all gone. I catch
sight of a small door, in the panelling, on my right at the
end of this corridor, closing quickly. They are gone evidently
to visit some other quarter of the house. They might
have stopped for me. Very unsociable. One seems to hear
every footfall in this house. And even when you're not
speaking, your thoughts appear to find an echo, and to be
repeated aloud. In this short narrow gallery, there is an old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25">25</a></span>picture of a man in a Spanish dress, holding a melon in his
hand. His eyes follow me. Curious effect. I stop for a
moment. They are fixed on me. Remember some story about
this somewhere, when it turned out that there was a man concealed,
who came out to murder people at night, living happily
behind the picture in the day-time. Cheer myself up by
thinking that if Milburd had seen this picture he'd have named
it &#8220;The Meloncolic Man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Odd. I don't hear their voices. They can't be playing me
any trick, and hiding. If there is a thing I detest, if there is
one thing above another absolutely and positively wicked and
reprehensible, it is hiding behind a door or a curtain .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or in
fact behind anything .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and then popping out on you suddenly.
Heard of a boy to whom this was done, and he remained
an idiot for the rest of his life.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;To look cautiously <i>at</i> the corners. To
open the small door quietly, and say, &#8220;Ah!&#8221; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No. No
one there. All gone down. A dark narrow winding staircase
(lighted only by loopholes), so that one is perpetually going
round angles and might come upon anyone, or anyone upon
you, without any sort of preparation. I can quite understand
assassins coming down on their victim, or up on their victim, or
up and down, simultaneously, on their victim, in one of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26">26</a></span>old places. Assassins in the olden time. I wonder if it's true
about the White Lady? The old woman's husband was not
a bit frightened of her, so she says. Perhaps he had come
home rather tipsy, and mistook some shadow in the moonlight
for a ghost.</p>

<p>My eyes are fast becoming accustomed to this obscurity.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;There are no such things as ghosts.</p>

<p>On the whole, I'd rather meet a ghost, than a rat, or a
blackbeetle, or a burglar.</p>

<p>The diminishing scale, of what I would rather <i>not</i> meet in
a narrow staircase at night, is, the burglar, rat, blackbeetle,
ghost.</p>

<p>I hear something moving.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. below or above.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>I look cautiously back round the last corner.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;To shout out, &#8220;Hi! you fellows!&#8221;
Shouting would frighten a burglar, or a rat, but would have no
effect on a blackbeetle, or a ghost.</p>

<p>No answer. I descend a few more steps. Something seems
to be coming down behind me. Almost in my footsteps, and at
my pace. Ah! of course, echo. But why wasn't there an
echo when I shouted?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I will go on quicker. I'm not
a bit nervous, only the sooner I'm out of this, the better. At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27">27</a></span>last a door. Thick, solid, iron-barred, and nail-studded door.
Where's the handle? None. Yes, an iron knob. It won't
be turned. It won't be twisted. It's locked; or, if not,
fastened somehow. No; a faint light is admitted through the
keyhole, and by putting my eye to it, I can see a stone passage
on the other side. Perhaps the old woman has locked this by
accident. And perhaps they are not far off. I shake it. A
deep, low savage growl follows this, and I hear within two
inches of my toes, a series of jerky and inquisitive sniffs. The
sniffs say, as it were, &#8220;There's no doubt about it, I know you're
there;&#8221; the growl adds, &#8220;Show yourself, and I pin you.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Go upstairs again and return by the other
door.</p>

<p>Hope nobody, while I am mounting the steps again, will
open the door and let the dog up here for a run, or to &#8220;see who
it is,&#8221; in a professional way.</p>

<p>No. Up&mdash;up&mdash;up. Excelsior. I seem to be climbing
double the number of steps, in going up, to what I did in
coming down. My eyes too, after the keyhole, have not yet
become re-accustomed to the light. I pause. I could almost
swear that somebody, two steps lower down behind me, stopped
at the same instant.</p>

<p>Is there anyone playing the fool? Is it Milburd? I'll
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28">28</a></span>chance it, and ask. I say, &#8220;Milburd?&#8221; cautiously. No. Not
a sound. I own to being a little nervous. Someone&mdash;Boodels,
I think&mdash;once said that fine natures were always nervous.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;When nervous, reason with yourself quietly.</p>

<p>I say, to myself, reasoning, this is not <i>fright</i>: this is not
<i>cowardice</i>: it's simply nervousness. You wouldn't (this addressed
to myself) be afraid of meeting a .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for
instance .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. say .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a ghost .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no. Why should you?
You've never injured a ghost that you know of, and why should
a ghost hurt you? Besides .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. nonsense .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there are no
ghosts .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and as to burglars .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the house doesn't belong to
us yet, and so if I meet one, there'd be no necessity to struggle .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
on the contrary, I might be jocosely polite; I might say, &#8220;Make
yourself at home; you've as much right here as I have.&#8221; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
But, on second thoughts, no one would, or could, come here to
rob this place. It's empty.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Odd. I cannot find the door I came in at. I thought that
when I entered by it, I stepped on to a landing, but I suppose
that it is only a door in the wall, and opens simply on to a step
of the stairs.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is an unfrequented staircase. One might be
locked up here, and remain here, for anything that the old
woman, or her husband, would know about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29">29</a></span>
If one was locked away here, or anywhere, for how long
would it remain a secret?</p>

<p>When one has been absent from town for instance, for
months, and then returns, nobody knows whether you've been
in your own room all the time, or in Kamschatka. They say,
&#8220;Hallo! how d'ye do? How are you? Where have you been
this age?&#8221; They've never inquired. They've got on very
well without you. Important matters, too, which &#8220;absolutely
demand your presence,&#8221; as the letter says, which you find on
your table six months afterwards, settle themselves without
your interference.</p>

<p>The story of the Mistletoe Bough, where a young lady hides
herself in an oak chest, and is never heard of for years
(in fact never at all until her bones were found with her
dress and wreath,) is not so very improbable.</p>

<p>Suppose the old woman forgot this staircase, suppose my
party went off thinking that I was playing them some trick;
supposing they stick to that belief for four days, what should
<i>I</i> do?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don't know. I could howl, and shout. That's
all.</p>

<p>What chance of being discovered have I, except by a
tradesman wanting his quarter's account settled very badly
and being determined upon hunting me up wherever I was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30">30</a></span>
A door at last! And
light and fresh air through
the chinks. It opens easily,
and I am on the leads of
the roof.</p>

<p><span class="first-word">ust</span> as I am asking myself this, I meet Chilvern
on the roof. He is examining the
chimneys. The others are below choosing
their rooms. It appears that no one has
been up the narrow staircase except
myself. He shows me a different way
down.</p>

<p>We take another turn over the
house. This time more observantly.
Various orders of architecture. Chilvern, as an architect,
makes a professional joke. He says, &#8220;The best order of
architecture is an order to build an unlimited number of
houses.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Who was the first scientific builder?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32">32</a></span><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;Noah, when he invented arky-tecture. (N.B. This
will do for a Sunday conundrum.)</p>

<p>Part of it is very old, (the staircase and tower part where I've
been), and wall of the yard at the back, overgrown with ivy,
shows the remains of a genuine Norman arch.</p>

<p>Another quarter is decidedly Elizabethan, while a long and
well proportioned music room,&mdash;of which the walls and ceiling,
once evidently covered with paintings, are now dirty, damp, and
exhibiting, here and there, patches of colour not yet entirely
faded,&mdash;is decidedly Italian.</p>

<p>Of this apartment, the crone can tell us nothing. She
never recollects it inhabited. We undo the huge shutters
for ourselves, and bring down a cloud of dust and cobwebs.</p>

<p>The rays of light, bursting violently, as it were, into the
darkness&mdash;become&mdash;after once passing the square panes, or
where there are no panes, the framework&mdash;suddenly impure,
and in need of a patent filter before they are fit for use.</p>

<p>Chilvern admires the proportions, and asks what we'll make,
of this room?</p>

<p>A pause.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;A Theatre. Nothing more evident; nothing
easier.</p>

<p>I notice that both Boodels and Milburd catch at this idea.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33">33</a></span>From which I fancy, knowing from experience Boodels' turn
for poetry, that they have got, ready for production, what they
will call, &#8220;little things of their own that they've just knocked
off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Almost wish I hadn't suggested it. But if they've got something
to act, <i>so have I</i>. If they do <i>theirs</i>, they must let mine be
done.</p>

<p>Settled, that it is to be a theatre.</p>

<p>Odd that no one part of the house seems finished. Saxons
started it; Normans got tired of it; Tudors touched it up;
Annians added to it.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;(<i>Alliterative, on the plan of &#8220;A was
an Apple pie.&#8221;</i>)</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 10em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Saxons started it:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Normans nurtured it:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tudors touched it up:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Annians added to it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Georgians joiced it:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Victorians vamped it.</span>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Joice,&#8221; I explain, is a term derived from building; &#8220;to
joice, <i>i. e.</i> to make joices to the floors.&#8221; Chilvern says,
&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; To &#8220;vamp&#8221; is equal, in musical language, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34">34</a></span>&#8220;scamp&#8221; or to dodge up. The last owner evidently has
done this.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Good name for a Spanish speculative
builder&mdash;Don Vampa di Scampo. Evidently an architect of
<i>Ch&acirc;teaux d'Espagne</i>.</p>

<p>We visit the stables.
The gates are magnificent,
two lions sit on their tails,
and guard shields on two
huge pillars. After this
effort, the owner seems
to have got tired of the
place and left it.</p>

<p>We notice this of every
room, of various doors, of
many windows.</p>

</div>

<p>Successive tenants have
commenced with great
ideas, which have, so to speak, vanished in perspective.</p>

<p>Boodels becomes melancholy. He says, &#8220;I should call this
&#8216;The House of Good Intentions.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>I point out that these we are going to perfect and utilise.</p>

<p>We do so. The &#8220;odd man&#8221; to
toss again, and so on. I am the
last odd man. Boodels chooses the room with the stain on the
floor. He says he prefers it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37">37</a></span>
We drive back to Station. Thoughtful and sleepy journey.</p>

<p>Chilvern is to arrange all details as to fitting up and furnishing.
This, he says, he can do, inexpensively and artistically, in
a couple of weeks' time.</p>

<p>Milburd points out clearly to us that the old woman in charge
evidently doesn't want to be turned out, and so invented the
ghost. We all think it highly probable, except Boodels, who
says he doesn't see why there shouldn't be a ghost. We don't
dispute it.</p>

<span class="caption">&#8220;I&#39;LL TELL YOU WHAT YOU OUGHT TO DO.&#8221;</span>
</div>

<p>The next thing
is to make up a
party. Cazell
tells us &#8220;what
we ought to do.&#8221;
&#8220;We ought,&#8221; he
says, &#8220;to form
ourselves into a
committee, and
ask so many
people.&#8221;</p>

<p>We meet in the
evening to choose
our party. Rather difficult to propose personal friends, whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38">38</a></span>every one of us will like. We agree that we must be outspoken,
and if we don't like a guest proposed, we must say so,
and, as it were, blackball him.</p>

<p>Or <i>her</i>?&mdash;This remark leads to the question, Are there to be
any ladies? Boodels says decidedly, Yes.</p>

<p>Chilvern, putting it artistically, says, &#8220;We want a bit of
colour in a house like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cazell wants to know who is to be the host. Boodels proposes
me.</p>

<p>I accept the position; but what am I <i>exactly</i>? that's what I
must clearly understand.</p>

<p>Milburd explains&mdash;a sort of president of a Domestic Republic.</p>

<p>Very good. Then how about the ladies?</p>

<p>Chilvern says we must have a hostess. We all suppose,
doubtfully, that we must. I ask, Won't that interfere with our
arrangements?</p>

<p>Boodels replies, that &#8220;we can't have any arrangements without
a hostess.&#8221; He says, after some consideration, that he has
got a Grandmother who might be useful. Chilvern, deferentially,
proposes an Aunt of his own, but does not, as it were, press her
upon us, on account of some infirmities of temper. I've got a
half-sister who was a widow about the time I was born, and if
she's not in India&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39">39</a></span>
On the whole we think that if Boodels would have no
objection to his grandmother coming.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in the least,&#8221; says Boodels. &#8220;I think she can stand a
fortnight of it or so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carried nem. con. Boodels' grandmother to be lent for three
weeks, and to be returned safely.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought (to suggest to ladies).</i>&mdash;Why shouldn't there
be a sisterhood of chaperons? Let somebody start it. &#8220;Oh!&#8221;
says a young lady, &#8220;I can't go there wherever it is, because I
can't go alone, and I haven't got a chaperon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now carry out the idea. The young lady goes to The Home
(this sort of establishment is always a Home&mdash;possibly because
people to be hired are never <i>not</i> at home),&mdash;well, she goes to
the Home, sees the lady superioress or manageress, who asks her
what sort of a chaperon she wants. She doesn't exactly know;
but say, age about 50, cheerful disposition, polished manners.</p>

<p>Good. Down comes photograph book.</p>

<p>Young lady inspects chaperons and selects one.</p>

<p>She comes downstairs. &#8220;Is she,&#8221; asks the lady manageress,
&#8220;to be dressed for evening or for day, a f&ecirc;te or for what?&#8221;</p>

<p>Well then, that's all settled.</p>

<p>Terms, so much an hour, and something for herself. What the
French call a <i>pour boire</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40">40</a></span>
This is a genuinely good idea, and one to be adopted, I am
sure. What an excellent profession for ladies of good family
and education, of a certain age, and an uncertain income.</p>

<p>They might form a Social Beguinage, on the model of the
one at Ghent. No vows. All sorts of dresses. All sorts of
feeding. Respectable address. And a Home.</p>

<p>Boodels' grandmother, it turns out, is deaf.</p>

<p>Here again what a recommendation for a chaperon! and how

<p>(<i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Old
man for Mrs. Boodels,
to talk to her through
her ear-trumpet.)</p>

<p>Boodels says, &#8220;Oh, no!
his grandmother's never
dull.&#8221;</p>

<p>Milburd observes, that
this choosing is like
making up characters
for a play. He takes in
a theatrical newspaper,
and proposes that we
should set down what
we want, after the style
in which the managers
frame their advertisements.</p>

<p><i>Wanted.</i>&mdash;A First Old Man. Also A Leading Heavy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42">42</a></span>
He proposes &#8220;Byrton&mdash;Captain Byrton. He was in a dragoon
regiment.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Good for &#8220;Leading Heavy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Milburd's man is Byrton. Mine is Soames. I have an instinctive
dislike to Byrton, I don't know why, perhaps because
I perceive a certain amount of feeling against Soames.</p>

<p><i>Boodels' Proposal.</i>&mdash;That we should meet once a week to
determine whose invitations should be renewed, and whose
<i>cong&eacute;</i> should be given.</p>

<p><i>As President</i> I say, &#8220;Well, but I can't tell our guests that
they must go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cazell strikes in, &#8220;I tell you what we ought to do&mdash;only ask
everyone for a week, and then, if we like them, we can ask 'em
to stop on.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Agreed.</i>&mdash;That we take these matters into weekly consideration.</p>

<p>Milburd wishes to know who is to order dinner every day.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Take it in turn, and I'll begin as President.</p>

<p>Boodels, when this has been agreed to, says that we ought to
have good dogs about and outside a large house like that.</p>

<p>I tell them that there is one&mdash;a very fierce beast.</p>

<p>Boodels says he's sure I must be mistaken, as they went all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43">43</a></span>over the house, and there was only a little snarling, growling
puppy making darts at a mouse, or a rat, which he saw moving
behind some door which was locked.</p>

<p>[<i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Keep the facts to myself. Only a Puppy!
and I thought it was a mastiff! [Good name, by the way, for a
novel&mdash;<i>Only a Puppy</i>.] If I'd shaken that door again, then
they could have let me out.]</p>

<p>Simplest thing possible.</p>

<p>Hosts are so often in want of

another?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45">45</a></span>
<i>Easily</i>: if, in a central situation, there were a House, a large
House, where male guests of all sorts could be obtained.</p>

<p>I explain myself more clearly.</p>

<p>A lady says, &#8220;Oh dear! Our ball will be overdone with
ladies. I mean, we've got plenty of gentlemen, but&mdash;I don't
know what's the matter with the young men now-a-days, hardly
any of them <i>dance</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>If my Happy Thought is carried out, why here's her remedy.</p>

<p>Down she goes to the Home. Rings. Enters. Sees the
Brother Superior, or Manager.</p>

<p>&#8220;What sort of young men do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, specially for dancing, and generally effective.&#8221;</p>

<li>The Sprightly, or dining-out Brothers, shall pass, monthly,
an examination in good stories, anecdotes, and bons

Brothers and Playing Brothers to receive a fair percentage

amateurs, and know all about charades and extempore

<p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span class="first-word">eaf</span> people are very happy,&#8221; says Boodels,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; replies the Professor
of Scientific Economy; &#8220;a deaf person
can gain no information from
conversation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who does?&#8221; asks Bella, pertly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who finds mushrooms in a
field?&#8221; asks Chilvern, who has been engaged in this lately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give it up,&#8221; says Milburd. That's the worst of Milburd,
when a conversation is beginning to promise some results, he
nips it in the bud with the frost of his nonsense.</p>

<p>Bella asks what Mr. Chilvern was going to say. He has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54">54</a></span>nearly forgotten, but recalls it to his mind, on Cazell repeating
the word mushrooms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; says Chilvern, evidently feeling that the brilliancy
of his simile has been taken off by the interruption. &#8220;I was
going to say <i>&agrave; propos</i> of Miss Bella's remark about no one
gaining any information from conversation&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn't say <i>that</i>, Mr. Chilvern.&#8221;</p>

<p>No, of course not. We all side with Miss Bella.</p>

<p>Chilvern nowhere. &#8220;Ah, well,&#8221; he says, &#8220;I thought you did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if I had?&#8221; asks Miss Bella, triumphantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh!&mdash;well, if you <i>had</i>&mdash;&#8221; Chilvern meditates, and then
answers, &#8220;&mdash;if you had, why then I was going to say that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;
here he breaks off and finishes, &#8220;&mdash;well, it doesn't
matter now, but it <i>was</i> very good when I first thought of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He disappears, <i>i.e.</i>, from a conversational point of view, in
our laughter. He is extinguished.</p>

<p>&#8220;What's he saying?&#8221; asks Mrs. Boodels.</p>

<p>Milburd takes up the trumpet. &#8220;He says,&#8221; shouts Milburd,
it being quite unnecessary to shout, &#8220;that he's a very clever
fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; says Mrs. Boodels. &#8220;Mr. Chilvern's always joking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never said anything of the sort,&#8221; says the injured Chilvern
to her, defending himself through the ear-trumpet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55">55</a></span>
&#8220;Ah,&#8221; observes Mrs. Boodels, perfectly satisfied. &#8220;I was
sure he never could have said that.&#8221; Then she considers for a
few seconds. After this she remarks, &#8220;Cleverness, is not one
of his strong points.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereupon she smiles amiably. Chilvern walks to the
window.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were saying,&#8221; says the Professor, who evidently has a
whole three-volume lecture ready for us, &#8220;that deaf people are
happy. Now I controvert that opinion. To be deaf, is not a
blessing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; says Milburd, &#8220;a person who is deaf, is not a blessed
old man, or old woman, as the case may be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You misapprehend me, my dear Milburd. What I would
say about deafness, is this&mdash;&#8221; (<i>exit <span class="smcap">Bella</span>, quietly</i>,)&mdash;&#8220;is this&mdash;that
the loss of the sense of hearing&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is seldom the loss of hearing sense,&#8221; interrupts Boodels, at
the door.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Boodels</span>.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;To a certain extent,&#8221; continues the Professor, who has
Milburd, now, as it were, in his grasp. &#8220;Boodels, although
putting it lightly, was right. Sense is uncommon&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;'Specially common sense,&#8221; I observe. Being my first
remark for some time. But I like the Professor; and his
philosophic views have an interest for me that they evidently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56">56</a></span>do not possess for natures which will be always butterflying
about.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; says the Professor turning to me, whereupon
Milburd rises quietly, and gets to the door. (<i>Exit
<span class="smcap">Milburd</span>.</i>) &#8220;But common sense, though, I admit, wrongly
designated, does not convey to us a positive pleasure. The
question, which we are considering&mdash;namely, whether to be deaf,
is a happiness or not&mdash;should be treated in the Socratic method,
and the whole reasoning reduced to the simplest syllogisms.&#8221;</p>

<p>Through the window, I see Bella going out with Milburd.
Adelaide is with Boodels. Chilvern is pointing at me: they
are all laughing. I smile <i>to</i> them, and at them, as much as to
say, &#8220;Bless you! I'm with you in spirit, but the Professor has
my body.&#8221; Byrton I see meeting them. He has his driving coat
on. Hang it, they're going for some excursion without me.</p>

<p><i>Thoughts while the Professor is talking on the pleasures of
deafness.</i>&mdash;Where are they going to? Why didn't they tell
me? I think Bella <i>might</i> have given me some notion. If
she's with Milburd, won't he make fun of <i>me</i>? Is he trying
to cut me out, or not? If &#8220;yes,&#8221; it's deuced unfair of him.
Bella doesn't look back, or make any sign to me to come. If I
joined them now, should I be <i>de trop</i>? No. How can I? It's
all <i>our</i> party generally. They disappear into the shrubbery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57">57</a></span>
Professor suddenly asks me, &#8220;That <i>you'll</i> admit, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;(As I haven't heard a single word of what
he's been saying, to reply guardedly), &#8220;Well, to a certain extent,
perhaps&mdash;but&mdash;&#8221; then I pause, and frown, as if considering it,
whatever it is.</p>

<p>The Professor is lost in amazement. &#8220;But,&#8221; he exclaims,
&#8220;you <i>must</i> admit <i>that</i>. By what theory of approximation can
you show that we do not attain to such perfectibility of number;
unless you would say, as I <i>have</i> heard advanced by the Budengen
school, that the expression is but a formula adapted to our human
experience.&#8221;</p>

<p>I wonder to myself what point he is arguing with me. His
subject was Deafness.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;(In order to find out where he's got to in
his lecture, ask him). &#8220;Yes, but how does this tell upon Deafness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will show you; but it is impossible to discuss conclusions
unless we settle our premisses.&#8221; [I hear the trap in the stable
yard and Byrton woa-woaing. Bother!] &#8220;Will you bring some
deep objection to a premiss which is fundamental&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>

<p>I beg his pardon, which premiss?</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Better find out what he <i>is</i> talking about,
then differ from him point blank, and leave the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58">58</a></span>
<i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Pair off. Same idea as that excellent
parliamentary arrangement, when you agree to differ with
another member, for a whole session, on every question, and
then go away and enjoy yourself.</p>

<p>&#8220;The premiss,&#8221; repeats the Professor, &#8220;that you would not
admit just now. I do not say,&#8221; he adds&mdash;[I hear the wheels.
Can I jump up and say, &#8220;Excuse me!&#8221; and run out. I could if
I was a young lady, or an elderly one. But a man can't do it,
specially as President, or Host, without being rude]&mdash;&#8220;that you
had not good grounds, but what are those grounds?&#8221; Here he
plants his <i>binocle</i> on his nose, leans back and stares at me.</p>

<p>Good Heavens! If I hadn't differed from him, or, I mean, if
I'd only understood what the&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;(<i>To ask seriously</i>), &#8220;Re-state, exactly,
the premiss I disputed.&#8221; [I'm sure to catch a glimpse of the
trap and horses as they drive past the lake. Hang the Professor!]</p>

<p>&#8220;Simply,&#8221; says he, &#8220;in putting the first premiss, I used the
old formula, viz., that the point in question was as clear as that
two and two make four.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Heavens! have I been disputing <i>that</i> with you?&#8221; I
almost shout.</p>

<p>&#8220;What else?&#8221; he asks, astonished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59">59</a></span>
&#8220;Why .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; I really cannot speak, I am so annoyed.
I've lost a whole morning, and whole day, perhaps, and a jolly
party, and&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;What's the matter?&#8221; asks Mrs. Boodels, handing her
instrument of torture to the Professor. &#8220;What does he
say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He says&mdash;&#8221; commences the Professor&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><i>Je me sauve!</i> (<i>Exit myself, hurriedly.</i>) I rush to the
stable.</p>

<p>&#8220;James! Where are they gone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They said, sir, as they were gone to the meet. 'Ounds is
out near 'ere.&#8221;</p>

Miss Adelaide Cherton, &#8220;it's literally
set in for rain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Boodels, without troubling
herself to raise her ear-trumpet,
smiles blandly and proceeds with
her knitting.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i> A deaf person can always talk to herself,
and obtain a hearing.</p>

<p>Miss Bella exclaims, &#8220;Oh, what shall we do if it rains?&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereupon Miss Medford observes that the gentlemen will
amuse us.</p>

<p>[Miss Medford is an addition to our party. She was brought
by Mrs. Orby Frimmely, and Mr. Frimmely subsequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61">61</a></span>came down with her brother Alfred Medford, a celebrated
musical amateur, &#8220;of the
nobility's concerts.&#8221; &#8220;A very
interesting looking young
man,&#8221; Mrs. Boodels observes
aloud when he arrives, but
she is a little afraid of him

has one.]</p>

Soames observes that he shall
devote his day to correcting
his great work on Scientific
Economy for the press.
Mrs. Orby Frimmely says,
that &#8220;it's wonderful to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62">62</a></span><i>her</i>, how Mr. Soames thinks of all the clever things he
writes.&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p>Soames remarks upon this, modestly, that &#8220;he has made the
one subject his study, and all his thoughts are given to its development.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Boodels requests that the Professor's last observation
may be repeated to her.</p>

<p>Solo on the Ear-trumpet by Miss Medford. Milburd strolls
in, then Boodels. Mrs. Boodels suddenly informs everyone that
she is deeply interested in Mr. Soames' work, and, as it is a wet
day, will he read some of it aloud to amuse us?</p>

<p>The ladies look at one another and smile. Mrs. Orby
Frimmely exclaims, &#8220;Oh do,&#8221; and laughs.</p>

<p>Milburd says it's just the thing to while away a happy hour,
and instances the Polytechnic as being his favourite place of
amusement in London.</p>

<p>Mr. Soames replies to this that the Polytechnic and himself
are different institutions.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; says Milburd; &#8220;go ahead!&#8221; Whereupon Milburd
rushes into the library. Silence during his absence. It is
broken by Medford asking Boodels if he's ever seen the trick
with the shilling in the tumbler? Boodels replies that he has,
but would like to see it again. Medford is just producing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63">63</a></span>his shilling when the Professor returns. The Professor, who
has been searching for something in his note book, now asks
if they (the ladies) really wish to hear some of his new
book.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! do!&#8221; enthusiastically everybody.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will fetch it down,&#8221; says the Professor, much pleased, and
leaves the room.</p>

<p>Medford holds up the shilling and says, &#8220;You see this shilling.&#8221;
Boodels begs his pardon for a minute, and, referring to the
Professor, asks, &#8220;I say, haven't we let ourselves into too much
of a good thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Frimmely observes &#8220;that it'll be something to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Adelaide says, &#8220;I hate lectures.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Bella strikes in with, &#8220;Well, if he bores, we can ask him
questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>It appears that he's going to have a lively time of it.</p>

<p>Milburd re-enters; he has arranged the library, and begs us to
&#8220;Walk up!&#8221; as if it were a show.</p>

<p>Medford observes that there will be time before the lecture
begins to show his conjuring trick with the shilling.</p>

<p>Cazell interrupts him with the gong from the hall, and Chilvern
plays a march on the piano. Medford pockets his shilling and
observes that &#8220;he'll do it afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64">64</a></span>
The Professor appears on the scene. He requests that there
may be no Tomfoolery.</p>

<p>I say to him, &#8220;No, of course not,&#8221; as I really do wish Milburd
would show some consideration, and treat the matter seriously.</p>

<p>Milburd apologises for his fun, and we attend the Professor to
the library. There we find a black board, a glass of water, and
a piece of chalk.</p>

<p>&#8220;I propose,&#8221; commences the Professor, &#8220;dealing with the
Pleasures of Wealth.&#8221; &#8220;Brayvo!&#8221; from Milburd. Immediately
frowned down by everybody.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have reduced the calculation to a simple formula, intelligible
to all intellects of more or less cultivation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Medford asks me in a whisper if I <i>do</i> know his trick with a
shilling. I return &#8220;hush&#8221; and look serious.</p>

<p>Winks between Byrton and Chilvern.</p>

<p>Catching the Professor's eye, Chilvern looks suddenly solemn
and deeply interested. It <i>is</i> a pity that they will go on being
buffoons.</p>

<p>&#8220;The study of algebra suggests the mode of treatment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wry face made by Mrs. Frimmely.</p>

<p>Mrs. Boodels is seated, placidly, with her ear-trumpet
raised and on her lips a smile of calm contentment, from
which we subsequently infer that she doesn't catch one word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65">65</a></span>
&#8220;As the wealth so the Pleasure. [<i>Here he draws on his
slate. Milburd inquires, &#8216;What's that?&#8217; but is hushed down.</i>]</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;As <i>x</i> : 2 :: <i>b</i> : 5.</p>

<p>&#8220;The product of the extremes equals the product of the
Means, and as long as this sum in proportion is observed, Ruin
is impossible.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8258; The key here is that <i>b</i> = &pound;1,000,000.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then:&mdash;</p>

</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bad sum per annum,&#8221; says the Professor, smiling, in
order to throw a little pleasantry into the matter, which is
becoming a trifle heavy. Mrs. Boodels asleep. &#8220;Though I
thought it was more when I commenced the equation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will now,&#8221; he says, &#8220;write down a text.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To <i>Give</i> is a Wealthy Pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;And on this I make what I call &#8216;suggestions.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66">66</a></span>
&#8220;The poor man has it in his power to cause the Rich great
pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let <b>I</b> stand for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>(&#8220;Impossible,&#8221; interrupts <ins title="Milburn">Milburd</ins>, <i>sotto voce</i>. Our Philosophic
Lecturer takes no notice. He is rising with his subject).</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us say &#8216;<b>I</b> is poor.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Bella says, &#8220;Excuse me a moment,&#8221; and vanishes. Wish
I could get out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let all <b>I</b>'s rich friends subscribe according to their means
from &pound;5 upwards.</p>

<p>&#8220;Result, easily attained, &pound;5,000.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say that eighty people subscribed &pound;62 10<i>s.</i> apiece. Are
there not eighty people in London, Manchester, and Liverpool
who could do this and not miss it so much as I should miss a
farthing put by accident into a Church plate&mdash;of course I mean
by mistake for half a sovereign.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how could such a mistake arise? you would say.&#8221;</p>

<p>(We wouldn't, but <i>he</i> couldn't tell that.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Why simply because I never give less in Church than half a
sovereign. <i>Ergo</i>, I never give in Church unless I have half a
sovereign in my pocket. <i>But</i> I <i>never</i> have half a sovereign in
my pocket.&#8221;</p>

<p class="indent">[Smiles from everyone, and applause from Milburd,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67">67</a></span>towards whom the Professor looks appealingly, as much as to
say, &#8220;There, I can be just as funny as <i>you</i>, only without
Tomfoolery.&#8221;]</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ergo .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. cela va sans dire.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;So, you see, eighty people could make &#8216;<b>I</b>&#8217; happy.</p>

<p class="indent">[Medford is practising his trick with a shilling by himself.]</p>

<p>&#8220;Which is equivalent to saying that eighty people could
make <i>me</i> happy.</p>

<p>&#8220;And &#8216;<b>I</b>&#8217; has it, you observe, in his power to make eighty
people happy by accepting the subscription.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Note, which I suggest to the Professor.</i> Should this ever
meet the eye of Baron Rothschild, let him remember, that by
his single act, he can attain to the happiness of eighty people.</p>

<p>&#8220;If any of you, here present, happen to be acquainted with
the Baron, and will introduce me to him, it will be, I am sure,
a step in the interests of humanity generally, and not without
its beneficial results to individuals particularly.&#8221; (&#8220;Hear!
hear!&#8221;)</p>

<p class="center" style="letter-spacing: 1em; margin-right: -1em;">.......</p>

<p>With this bit of Practicality the lecture concludes.</p>

<p>He tells me, in confidence, that he finished quickly because
he felt he was &#8220;above his audience.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68">68</a></span>
Milburd subsequently offers to introduce the Professor to
Baron Rothschild &#8220;for a consideration.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center" style="letter-spacing: 3.5em; margin-right: -3.5em;">***</p>

<p>No one, as yet has found any of the pleasures of Poverty.</p>

<p>Some one says &#8220;Absence of Income-tax.&#8221; This is met with
Absence of Income. Solution rejected.</p>

<p class="center" style="letter-spacing: 3.5em; margin-right: -3.5em;">***</p>

<p>We found afterwards on our Scientific Lecturer's table
MSS. of</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2.5em;"><i>&#8220;Letters to Rothschild&#8221; by a Professor of Scientific
Economy.</i></p>

<p>One commences thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Dear Baron,</i></p>

<p><i>You will doubtless be surprised at hearing from an
humble individual who has nothing but his Scheme of Personal
Scientific Economy, and his unblemished character, to
recommend him to your notice.</i></p>

<p><i>I am getting up a subscription for myself. This sounds,
put shortly, egotistical. On the contrary, it is Cosmopolitanly
Philanthropical. If I am enabled to teach my doctrines for
nothing, I shall, then, be slave to no man, no, not even to
myself, as represented by my own necessities. May I head the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69">69</a></span>list with a sum worthy your munificence and perfectly
Oriental wealth? Yes. I hear you say &#8216;yes.&#8217; I knew it.
I shall put your Lordship down for &pound;20,000, and will
be careful to send you a receipt for the money. Business is
business.</i></p>

<p style="margin-left: 20em;"><i>Yrs., &amp;c.</i></p>

<p style="margin-left: 22em;"><span class="smcap"><i>J. Soames.</i></span></p></blockquote>

<p class="center" style="letter-spacing: 3.5em; margin-right: -3.5em;">***</p>

<p>Perhaps one day the Professor of Scientific Economy will
publish his &#8220;<i>Letters to Baron Rothschild</i>.&#8221; But I don't think
there will ever appear a very voluminous collection of &#8220;<i>Letters
of Baron R. to Mr. Jenkyns Soames</i>.&#8221;</p>

<hr style="width: 2.5em; height: 1px; color: black; background-color: black; border: none; margin: 1.5em auto 1.5em auto;" />

<p>Milburd asks him &#8220;what he should say were the pleasures
of poverty.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Professor considers.</p>

<p>We all consider.</p>

<p>The Professor wishing to do everything methodically, writes
on the slate in large type THE PLEASURES OF POVERTY.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First</span> Pleasure<span style="padding-left: 1em; letter-spacing: 1em;">......</span></p>

<p class="center" style="letter-spacing: 4em; margin-right: -4em; line-height: 1.5em;">.....<br/>....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70">70</a></span>
Then he pauses. Then he speaks. &#8220;On thorough consideration,
I am convinced that Poverty has no pleasures.</p>

<p>&#8220;If any, they are peculiar.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are Grim Pleasures.</p>

<p>&#8220;One grim Pleasure of Poverty is talking about ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A very poor subject,&#8221; observes Miss Medford.</p>

<p>After a silence, during which I am just on the point of
saying something, but don't, the Professor adds,</p>

<p>&#8220;No. We try very hard, but can <i>not</i> see any pleasure in
Poverty.&#8221;</p>

<p>We lounge over the room
undecidedly. Mrs. Boodels
thinks it's still raining. Pouring.
Miss Bella says, &#8220;What
a bother!&#8221; Miss Medford remembers
having heard a
problem worthy the Professor's
attention. We pause in our indecision, and she reads
from her album.</p>

<p class="center"><i>What circumstance most justifies loss of patience?</i></p>

<p><i>The Professor of Scientific Economy</i> replies, a smoky
chimney.</p>

<p>&#8258; He explains that he is thinking of a bitterly cold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72">72</a></span>day in winter when he wanted to sit in his study, and write a
treatise on the <i>Amount of change to be obtained out of a
Roman Denarius</i>, <span class="smcap-capitals">B.C.</span> 108. On this occasion his chimney
<i>would</i> smoke, and he had to sit with the door and window
open. Then the smoke choked him; next, the draught gave
him cold; then his fingers became frozen; finally, his feet were
like icicles in refrigerating stockings. After standing this for
about two hours, he could not help saying.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Evidently a case where the Recording Angel would not
even chance a blot.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;What a mess that book <i>will</i> be in.
Perhaps <i>illegible</i>!!</p>

<p class="center" style="font-size: 1.2em;">&#8258;</p>

<p>Miss Adelaide Cherton thinks that to find a wasp inside the
only peach on the wall was most provoking.</p>

<p><i>Byrton's Opinion.</i> Hot coffee over your new cords on a
&#8220;show-meet&#8221; day.</p>

<p>It strikes me that to come on shore after taking a swim in
the river, and not to be able to find your clothes, is a circumstance
quite justifying loss of patience.</p>

<p>Apropos of this, Chilvern says he recollects a fellow&mdash;Smith,
a friend of his&mdash;bathing, and when he came out he couldn't find
his clothes. So, as some people were coming along the bank,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73">73</a></span>Smith retired to the stream, and Chilvern went to search for
the habiliments. The fact was, that Smith had gone down <i>with
the stream</i>, and his clothes had been consequently left a mile
behind.</p>

<p>Chilvern found the clothes, then returned, but couldn't find
Smith.</p>

<p>The current had taken him down stream another mile.</p>

<p>So it might have gone on; had not the river been a tidal one
(or worked on some peculiar principles, which Chilvern doesn't
explain)&mdash;and, the stream changing, back brought Smith
with it, and then he was happy,&mdash;only with a cold for ever
after.</p>

<p>Mrs. Boodels being informed of the discussion through her
ear-trumpet, said that losing a thimble was quite sufficient to
justify any loss of patience.</p>

<p>The gentlemen present observe, that they have no doubt it
is so, but they have had no experience.</p>

<p>Milburd thinks that the button off your collar, or, losing
your stud, <i>at the last moment</i>, is the most trying thing.</p>

<p>Bella Cherton, after walking to the window several times and
seeing no sign of fine weather, says, &#8220;I'll tell you what I consider
most justifies loss of patience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; we inquire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74">74</a></span>
&#8220;<i>Sitting here</i>!&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i> This sort of reply rather throws a damper over efforts
to be genial. Mrs. Boodels wishes it to be repeated to her
through the trumpet. Damper through the ear trumpet.</p>

<p>Mrs. Orby Frimmely says, that trying to get through your
favourite valse with a bad partner.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ah!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. O. F.'s Happy Thought.</i> &#8220;By the way, as it is so wet,
why not have a dance? Mr. Medford can play.&#8221;</p>

<p>Seconded by Byrton, and supported by the ladies.</p>

<p>Adjournment to Drawing-Room. Odd. We suddenly fall
into our ball-room manners. Talking to partners quietly.
Going out to get cool,&mdash;on the stairs.</p>

<p>Byrton is dancing with Mrs. Orby Frimmely. Mr. Orby
Frimmely being engaged in town is not here.</p>

<p>Byrton is certainly very much struck, in fact he says so; and
shows it. However, he is always being struck, always saying so,
always showing it, and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that's all.</p>

<p>Jenkyns Soames has retired to his room; probably to write
to Rothschild.</p>

<p>Chilvern is Miss Cherton's partner.</p>

<p>Milburd is Miss Bella's.</p>

<p><i>I don't dance.</i> I debate with myself whether I <i>can</i> or not.
I used to. In a waltz for instance, I know two steps out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75">75</a></span>three. The third is where I fail. Dances change so. My
waltz is the <i>Deux temps</i>, for the simple reason that the <i>Deux
temps</i> does also for the galop, that is, it does for my galop.</p>

<p>I flatter myself on my galop. Here, so to speak, I am at
home. If Medford can only play a galop, and if Miss Bella
will give up Milburd, or Milburd give her up, why <i>je suis son
homme</i>. I am her man.</p>

<p>Medford will do a galop, he says; and immediately before I
have time to ask if Bella&mdash;if Miss Bella .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he strikes into it
and the dancers change their step, and are whirling round and
round, then up and down. I can't stop them. As the opera
books say, &#8220;Rage! Madness! Despair!&#8221;</p>

<p>I catch <i>her</i> eye.</p>

<p>She understands, I am sure.</p>

<p>She will&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>If she does&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>She stops, making some excuse to Milburd and looking at me.
(Aha! Milburd! you think yourself such a lady killer, that a .&nbsp;.
this to myself, <i>thinkingly</i>).</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;To go up to her and say, &#8220;You promised
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>I do it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I?&#8221; she says.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76">76</a></span>
Milburd gives in, unexpectedly, and relinquishes her.</p>

<p>Aha! we are off! Round and round .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. carpet rather bad
to dance on .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. up and down .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I feel that we are just skirting
chairs, and that another inch will bring down the fire-irons&mdash;&mdash;we
put on the pace .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I haven't danced for .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, for
some considerable time .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we nearly come bang against the
piano .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my fault .&nbsp;. beg pardon .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but we won't stop&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no!&#8221; says Bella .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and we don't stop.</p>

<p>A little quieter, just to, as it were, regain consciousness,
for everything is becoming blurred&mdash;(jerky sentences while
dancing) .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#8220;It's more difficult .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to steer when .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there
are a few .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. than when&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; says Miss Bella, who
quite <ins title="undertands">understands</ins>. (<i>Myself tenderly.</i>) &#8220;Do you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. like
dancing?&#8221; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. (<i>whirl round, up and down</i> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
then) .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#8220;This dance?&#8221; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. (<i>whirl round just
to get the steam up again for the question, and put it sotto
voce, finding myself close to her ear&mdash;such a pretty little ear&mdash;made
to be whispered into</i>). &#8220;Do you like this dance?&#8221; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
&#8220;Very much.&#8221; (<i>My heart is fluttering nervously, like a
stray bird under a skylight</i>) .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#8220;With anyone?&#8221; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. (<i>No
answer .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My question means do you prefer <span class="smcap-capitals">ME</span> to dance
with, and not only to dance with, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i>)</p>

<p>The music ceases. Medford is tired. We all thank him.</p>

Busts are the most so.</p>

<p>Do you want a sensation
of Miserable Melancholy?</p>

<p>Take, yourself&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Off to a dusty library of
bookshelves, chiefly empty,
and the remainder having
an occasional medical treatise in the original Latin, with
diagrams of the human frame, no fire, rain pouring, damp mist
over the landscape, no pens, ink, or even paper to tear up
into fanciful shapes, and nothing for company except busts of
celebrated people, looking like the upper part of the ghosts of
half-washed chimney-sweepers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81">81</a></span>
After a time, they only resemble one thing, a collection of
several homicidal criminals.</p>

<p>Sit before a bust, any bust, under the above circumstances.</p>

<p>You wonder to what you would have condemned this hideous
creature had he been brought up, in his lifetime, before you,
as a magistrate.</p>

<p>On every feature is stamped Ruffian. This man <i>must</i> have
been hung, were there any justice in the world.</p>

<p>No. This bust is of the late venerable and excellent Archbishop
Snuffler.</p>

<p>Is it possible. And all these other savage-looking creatures?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
&#8220;Are,&#8221; says my informant in the damp
library who only comes in for a minute, &#8220;Archbishops,
Bishops, celebrated Philanthropists, Doctors, and men of
science.&#8221;</p>

<p>And here they are perched up aloft, like overgrown
cherubs, whose wings have been taken off by some surgical
operation.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;If you want to be revenged on somebody,
and don't mind expense, have his portrait painted with all his
defects glaringly rendered, and present it, as a mark of esteem,
to his family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82">82</a></span>
On his fiftieth birthday give him a bust of himself to
be placed in his hall. Depend upon it you've punished
him.</p>

<p>Jenkyns Soames, our Professor of Scientific Economy, was
talking of the Zoological Gardens.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dispute,&#8221; says he, &#8220;the fact of the Hy&aelig;na laughing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? Solvitur ambulando, or rather non ambulando, for
I've stood in front of his cage for half an hour, and I've never
seen him laugh once.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was repeated to Mrs. Boodels.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; says she, &#8220;that's very <ins title="probable.&#8221; (superfluous &#8221; in original)">probable.</ins> But when Mr.
Jenkyns <i>went away</i> * *&#8221;</p>

<p>Milburd tried to cap this by asking as a conundrum &#8220;why
the Hy&aelig;na wouldn't laugh in your face?&#8221;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>As Mrs. Boodels rose, the ladies had to go out too, so no one
stopped for the answer. He caught me alone in a corner and
told me what it was. I think he said that it was because the
Hy&aelig;na was an <i>Hy-brid</i> animal. He explained that he meant
&#8220;<i>high-bred</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;To say, &#8220;Oh, that's very old.&#8221; This has
the same effect on a conundrum-maker as the most brilliant
repartee.</p>

<p>The age for compliments is gone. The courtly and polished
Abb&eacute;, who would have said the above epigrammatically
when it would have been considered remarkably witty, has
passed away. No one believes in compliment. It has no
currency, except done in a most commonplace way. But
the epigrammatic compliment, the well-prepared impromptu,
the careful rehearsed inspiration, is out of date. Now-a-days
there are no wits, and no appreciation of The Wits.
Conversation is damped by a bon-mot. An awful silence
follows the most brilliant <i>jeu de mot</i>, as sombre as the darkness
after a forked flash, or as the gardens at the Crystal
Palace after the last bouquet of fireworks.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="first-word">Being</span> deaf, Mrs. Boodels has, as our friend Captain
Byrton expresses it, six to four the best of us. Repartees
through an ear-trumpet lose their sting. And then you
can't in politeness, and in all respect, sting an old lady of
seventy-five.</p>

<p>The other evening Boodels says, blushingly, that some of his
friends tell him that he is just the man to write a comedy.</p>

<p>This is repeated to his grandmother through the trumpet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she says, quietly; &#8220;I've heard John's friends say that
he can write a comedy, and I've heard 'em add that <i>they hope

<p class="center" style="font-size: 1.2em;">&#8258;</p>

<p>I reply that we all like her,
and that she's a charming old
lady.</p>

<p>Milburd agrees.</p>

<p>Boodels says, rather testily, of course she's all <i>that</i>, but we
want some one more sprightly, and having to repeat everything
to her through the trumpet is tedious.</p>

<p>We own that we should not have liked to have been the first
to hazard this objection, but as he <i>has</i> made it himself, why we
perhaps on the whole agree with him rather than not.</p>

<p>Boodels is satisfied with this craftily qualified assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;The old girl,&#8221; he says,&mdash;(odd, how she's suddenly come down
in his estimation&mdash;down to &#8220;old girl&#8221;)&mdash;&#8220;has told me this morning
that the late hours are beginning to tell upon her, and she
wants to dine earlier!&#8221;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93">93</a></span>relation, &#8220;to dine at one o'clock or thereabouts, and tea at
six.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nursery hours! we couldn't think of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; returns Boodels; &#8220;so I said to her .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
She was rather huffed at the idea of my calling them &#8216;nursery
hours,&#8217; and wanted to know if I meant that she was in her
second childhood. In fact,&#8221; says Boodels, blurting it all out,
&#8220;there's been a row, and the old girl threatened to take away
the Chertons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; from both of us.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if she goes&mdash;&#8221; commences Boodels, who has a strict and
severe sense of propriety.</p>

<p>&#8220;If she does,&#8221; cries Milburd, &#8220;look here! I've got it.&#8221; He
subdues his excitement, and proceeds, &#8220;I've a letter from the
Regniatis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Regniatis! let's see,&#8221; considers Boodels. &#8220;They're relations
of yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Count Regniati, an Italian, and the jolliest fellow in
the world&#8221;&mdash;he adds this as a set-off against his nationality,
which may, he evidently thinks, suggest secret societies, daggers,
carbonari&mdash;&#8220;married my Aunt. The Chertons are also some
sort of distant connection. At least they often stay with
Madame. So that <i>she'll</i> be their chaperone. I'm sure you'll
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94">94</a></span>like 'em immensely,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;and the Signor, my uncle, is
first-rate.&#8221; We decide. Abdication of Mrs. Boodels and
enthronement of the Regniati dynasty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; exclaims Boodels. &#8220;Then I'll tell my grandmother
to-day. I don't want to do anything unpleasant&#8221;&mdash;we agree
with him, such a feeling does him honour&mdash;&#8220;and I'll take the
opportunity of her wanting to go up to an aurist to <i>cong&eacute;dier</i>
her. After all the old lady will be much happier away, and I'll
tell her that we shall be so glad to see her whenever she likes
to turn up again, that is, if the Hall is still going on.&#8221;</p>

<p>We admit that nothing could be more courtly, more diplomatic
than this.</p>

<p>Milburd is to invite his Uncle and Aunt. And that's settled.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="first-word">Mrs. Boodles</span> is deposed and retires, <i>vice</i> Madame
Regniati promoted.</p>

<p>Madame Regniati arrives alone. &#8220;The Signor,&#8221; as his
nephew Milburd always affectionately terms him, &#8220;has not
come by the same train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is just like Mr. Regniati,&#8221; observes Madame, severely.
&#8220;He said he'd leave me to look after the luggage. Mr. Regniati
has no notion of even looking after himself. Probably he has
lost himself. My luggage has come with me. I have his
ticket, and I know he has no money, as he has spent his
allowance this week. When Mr. Regniati has found himself
once more, I have no doubt he will appear.&#8221;</p>

<p>All this she delivers in disjointed sentences, with a little
pause or a cough between each. She speaks without any action,
and generally statuesquely. She prides herself evidently on her
classicality. She is more the antique Roman than the English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96">96</a></span>dame. It was this, Milburd, in smoking-room confidence,
informs us, that first inspired her with a liking for Mr. Regniati,
whom she met in Rome. Mr. Regniati was then a sculptor, and
might have gained, ultimately, a considerable reputation, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97">97</a></span>his good-natured indolence, and his social qualities, had not, in
the end, proved too much for his undoubted talent. Being
possessed of small private means, he would probably have
remained an amateur, seeing, not only without a particle of
envy, but with a smile of positive encouragement, others far
less able than himself, pass him on the road of art, and occupy
pedestals which ought to have been his. One evening meeting
Miss Milburd at an artistic reunion, she overheard him express
his admiration of her classical lineaments. Being mistress of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98">98</a></span>her own fortunes, and of her own fortune, she simply determined
to many Mr. Regniati; and did so. She foresaw his future
greatness. She looked forward to his name being enrolled
among those whom art has made illustrious. She was doomed
to disappointment.</p>

<span class="caption">MADAME REGNIATI
(<i>in fact</i>).</span>
</div>

<p>Transplanted to British soil, the Signor found himself a gentleman
at large. He abandoned the chisel for the gun, and
prided himself upon becoming a sportsman and an agriculturist.
From the moment of his being thus thoroughly acclimatised,
Madame Regniati gave him up, so to speak, then and there, as
a bad job. The Signor's private means were not anything like
enough to supply his peculiarly English tastes, and his wife
would not &#8220;fritter <i>her</i> money away,&#8221; she said, &#8220;in pigsties.&#8221;</p>

<p>So she decided upon giving up their rural retreat which she
had chosen for the purpose of affording Mr. Regniati every
opportunity of communing with nature, and took him up to
London. Here she obtained a small house, with a studio, built
out at the back by its previous artistic occupant, where she
fondly hoped Mr. Regniati would once more devote himself to
the study of the fine arts.</p>

<p>Her husband now appeared to be inclined towards her way
of thinking. The more, because his funds were in her hands,
and she &#8220;allowanced&#8221; him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99">99</a></span>
He commenced a group, several sizes larger than life, of
<i>The Judgment of Paris</i>.</p>

<p>The process was slow, and, apparently, far from inexpensive.
Moreover it was excessively fatiguing, and Madame, proud of
her husband's design, and sanguine as to his future, willingly
permitted the Signor to take occasional relaxation in the country.</p>

<p>He was obliged to come to her from time to time for money.
The allowance was insufficient.</p>

<p>This gradually aroused her suspicions. She had permitted
the introduction of living models to the studio, out of regard for
the necessities of art, but it was her invariable custom to bring
her work thither, while Mr. Regniati was engaged in modelling
from nature. He was seldom out of her sight, nor did he,
indeed, appear at all anxious to be other than most eager
for her companionship, except on the holiday occasions, when
he sought invigoration in the country. Then he represented
that he loved solitude, and generally selected a time when
Madame was too indisposed even to offer to join him in his
excursion.</p>

<p>Madame became, in fact, jealous.</p>

<p>Being a woman of deeds, not words, she determined to ascertain
the truth, before she startled the Signor with the expression
of a suspicion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100">100</a></span>
The Signor asked her for money. She gave it to him
cheerfully, regretted that her rheumatism was so bad as
to confine her to her room, begged him to stay away until he
felt quite restored and able to go on with Minerva's toes (he
had got so far with the three goddesses, but, having commenced
with the toes, this was not much as representing
the labour of nearly a year and a half), and wished him
good-bye.</p>

<p>The Signor went to Dunby Dale, a small, out-of-the-way
village in Hampshire, totally unaware of being closely followed
by Madame's maid, who gave the information, and then by
Madame herself.</p>

<p>The Signor was traced to a small farm-house, beautifully
situated, and in the most perfect order.</p>

<p>He was welcomed, respectfully, at the door by a fresh-looking,
buxom country wench.</p>

<p>The following conversation was overheard.</p>

<p>[The Signor's English is far from perfect.</p>

<p>He divides every syllable, <i>more Italiano</i>, and talks not
unmusically in rather a high key. Most of his conversation
is, as it were, written for a tenor, and he strains at it
like a low baritone. <i>Figurez-vous</i> a portly gentleman, brown
as walnut juice, dark black hair, moustache and beard. Teeth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101">101</a></span>flashing and brilliant, like a set of impromptu epigrams in
the mouth of a wit. Laughing lips, and eyes beaming with
good-nature. Height five feet seven. <i>Voil&agrave; le Signor
Regniati.</i>]</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Mar-ree!&#8221;&mdash;this was to Mary the maid who had received
him. &#8220;You look all rose and pink. And 'ow does my leet-tel
Clo-teel-da? She is vell, I 'ope?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She gets on beautiful, sir,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;She's thrivin'
wonderful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; exclaimed the Signor, lighting up, and evidently
intensely delighted. &#8220;I <i>am</i> so glad. I come avays to see <i>'er</i>.
Tell me,&#8221; he continued, becoming suddenly serious, &#8220;'ave she
'ad 'er bart?&#8221; [The Signor almost sings his sentences. He
went up the scale to the verb &#8220;'ad,&#8221; and took a turn down
again three notes to the noun &#8220;bart,&#8221; which, by the way, was
his way of pronouncing &#8220;bath.&#8221;]</p>

<p>&#8220;Every day, sir,&#8221; replied the maid, cheerfully, &#8220;and her skin
looks as white as a young infant's.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the Signor was in <ins title="esctasies">ecstasies</ins>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;let us go an' see 'er.&#8221;</p>

<p>A good deal of the Signor's conversation resembles easy
lessons in one syllable for beginners. His &#8220;let us go and see
'er,&#8221; was delivered with a slight halt between each word, like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102">102</a></span>a child in a state of doubt over a column in a spelling
book.</p>

<p>They went into the house, and out, by the back way.</p>

<p>Madame Regniati soon discovered the worst. When the
Signor had gone, she called at the house herself, and found that
the Signor rented a lodging of the farmer, and, <i>kept a pig</i>.</p>

<p>Though forced to give up the country, he could not deny
himself this agricultural pleasure. His first pig had won a
prize, and the farmer showed Mrs. Regniati the account of the
Cattle Show in a local paper, with Mr. Regniati exhibiting
under the name of &#8220;Tomkins,&#8221; and then, in the fulness of his
heart, he brought out a silver medal, tied to a blue riband and
preserved in a case of morocco leather, on which was inscribed
that this represented the second prize for pigs awarded by the
Judges to Mr. Regniati, as &#8220;Tomkins,&#8221; for the sow Selina, and
then followed date, place, and other particulars.</p>

<p>After this discovery there was an arrangement. Mr. Regniati
was allowed a small farm-house in the country, on condition of
his not <i>wasting</i> money upon it, and only taking to it as a
recreation, while the greater portion of his time he would be,
henceforth, in honour bound to dedicate to his Art.</p>

<p>The Signor accepted these terms.</p>

<p>In six years' time he had got as far as the third pair of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103">103</a></span>knees,&mdash;Juno's,&mdash;and had obtained the first prize for pigs, and
the second for bullocks, at a County Show.</p>

<p>This success lured him on to his ruin. At the expiration of
ten years, Venus had a head on her shoulders, and he had
almost lost his own. There had been years of disease among
the cattle, insects in the turnips, and rottenness in the heart of
his mangels; his expenses had become enormous, the Inspector
of Nuisances had complained of the state of the drains
round and about his farm, his oxen had strayed, two bulls
had got loose and had maimed several people for life, whom
he had to pension as long as they were unable to work,&mdash;and
their inability to work appeared to increase with the
duration of the pension. In fact Mr. Regniati's model farm
promised to eventuate in a gigantic failure. At this crisis
Madame stepped in and saved the citadel.</p>

<p>She simply got rid, <i>sur-le-champ</i>, of the live-stock, man and
beast.</p>

<p>Then she disposed of the house and outbuildings.</p>

<p>The Signor went down, and sat, like Marius, or rather like a
second Cincinnatus, when, on returning from the metropolis, he
found that his farm had gone utterly to the bad.</p>

<p>After this, Signor Regniati went hard to work on Juno.
A year's toil brought its reward. Madame his wife was pleased
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104">104</a></span>to sit as his model, and, ultimately, to purchase for him a small
game preserve, and a shooting box in Bedfordshire, at an easy
distance from town.</p>

<p>It was on his way to Budgeby Box that the Signor came to
us at Happy-Thought Hall, and brought Madame; or rather,
that Madame came and brought the Signor.</p>

<p>Milburd was now the Signor's constant companion. Madame
trusted, she said, Mr. Regniati to his nephew. Mr. Regniati,
she adds, is a child. &#8220;I expect no responsibility from him. I
look to Richard for that. Richard must take care of his uncle,
and go out shooting with him, as I will <i>not</i> have,&#8221; she says,
emphatically &#8220;I will <i>not</i> have Mr. Regniati going out with a
gun, <i>alone</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>If Mr. Regniati is present when these remarks are made, he
merely smiles, quite happily, stretches out his arms, and
exclaims, in a tone of the slightest remonstrance possible, &#8220;Oh,
my dear! I can shoot! I am quite safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; returns Madame, &#8220;and I mean you to keep so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I vas born for a sport-mans,&#8221; Mr. Regniati observes
to us.</p>

<p>I notice that he is fond of putting words into a sort of plural
of his own invention.</p>

<p>&#8220;You're lucky, Mr. Regniati,&#8221; observes his wife, &#8220;to find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105">105</a></span><i>that</i> out at all events. For my part I can't make out why you
were ever born at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the Signor smiles, and says in cheerful remonstrance,
&#8220;Oh my dear!&#8221; but he is too wise to continue a conversation
which would only involve an argument, and perhaps, the loss of
his &#8220;lee-tel shoot-box at Bod-ge-bee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dick, <i>i.e.</i> Milburd, benefits considerably by this arrangement.
His aunt pays all the expenses (trusting Mr. Regniati
with no money), as long as he and his uncle are together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Richard,&#8221; she says, &#8220;is clever and careful. My husband
is a schoolboy. I can only trust a schoolboy with a
tutor.&#8221;</p>

<p>We are at dinner when the Signor arrives.</p>

<p>He enters in a state of great excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; he exclaims, &#8220;'Ow do you do?&#8221; this to everyone
generally. &#8220;Ah Deeck!&#8221; this to Milburd, reproachfully. &#8220;Vy
you not meet me at ze Rail-vays?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You'd better go and dress yourself, Mr. Regniati,&#8221; remarks
Madame, drily, finishing her soup, &#8220;or you won't have any
dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear!&#8221; he cries, &#8220;No din-ner! I am so 'ongry. I 'ave
no-sing to eat since my break-fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You should have been here before,&#8221; says Madame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106">106</a></span>
&#8220;My Jo!&#8221; he exclaims, in a very high key, almost between
laughing and crying. I find out that &#8220;My Jo,&#8221; is <i>his</i> rendering
of &#8220;By Jove!&#8221;&mdash;a very harmless oath&mdash;&#8220;My Jo! I could
not!&#8221; Then he enters appealingly to us into an explanation.
&#8220;Madame Regniati vas in ze car-ri-age, and she say to me, Mr.
Regniati, she say, I did not see ze boxes-put-in,&#8221;&mdash;this is all
one word.&mdash;&#8220;I say my dear eet ees all right. She say No you

I see no-sing, no veres, den ven I try to find my car-ri-age again

<p>&#8220;Nonsense, Mr. Regniati. I believe you stopped at the
refreshment-room in London&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh My Jo! my dear! I as-sure you,&#8221; he commences, but
Madame cuts him short.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go and dress, Mr. Regniati,&#8221; she says, &#8220;and don't be long.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107">107</a></span>Dick, show Mr. Regniati his room, and bring him down in five
minutes. Don't let him chatter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Milburd takes his uncle out, and we hear him repeating his
story to his nephew, as he crosses the hall, and ascends the
stairs.</p>

<p><i><span class="first-word">unday</span> Meditations.</i>&mdash;When we first saw
this place we called it The House of
Good Intentions. It recurs to me
forcibly at this moment, as I look
over my note-book.</p>

<p>Under the heading of &#8220;Operanda,&#8221;
or Works to be done, I find:&mdash;</p>

<ol id="operanda"><li><i>Continuation of Typical Developments. Vol. III.</i></li>

<li><i>A Guide to Hertfordshire.</i></li>

<li><i>A Lesser Dictionary of French words not generally
found in other Lexicographical compilations.</i></li>

<li><i>Pendant to the above, &#8220;Every man his own lawyer and
somebody else's.&#8221;</i></li>

<li><i>Studies in the Country.</i> I thought I should have been
able to write a good deal in this line while at the
country-house. This was to include botany, farming,
agriculture generally, with a resumption of what I
took up years ago, as a Happy Thought, namely,
&#8220;Inquiries into, and Observations upon, the Insect
World.&#8221;</li></ol>

<p>Nothing of all this have I done. Not a line. It is
afternoon. We have most of us been to Church in the
morning, except Boodels and Chilvern. Those who have not
been, gave the following reasons for arriving at the same
conclusion.</p>

<p><i>Boodels' reason.</i> That he had a nasty headache, and should
not get up. [This he sent down to say at breakfast.]</p>

<p><i>Milburd's reason.</i> That the weather looked uncommonly
like rain. That to get wet <i>going</i> to Church is a most dangerous
thing, as you have to sit in your damp clothes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110">110</a></span>
<i>My own statement on the subject.</i> Milburd has puzzled me
by saying it's going to rain. Is it? If it isn't, nothing I should
enjoy more than going to Church. Wouldn't miss it on any
account, except of course out of consideration for one's
health.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;I don't feel very well this morning, and
damp feet might be followed by the most serious results.</p>

<p>Miss Adelaide and Miss Bella are going. Their chaperonship
this morning devolves upon Mrs. Frimmely, as Madame
and the Signor are Catholics, and have been to mass, early in
the morning, at St. Romauldi's Missionary College, near here.
Madame is very strict, and the Signor is not partial to early
rising. The College Service being at half-past eight in the
morning, they have to rise at seven on Sundays, and then
there is a drive of four miles. The following dialogue is
overheard:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Time, 7.15 <span class="smcap-capitals">A.M.</span> Scene, <span class="no-italics">Signor</span> and <span class="no-italics">Madame's</span> room. <span class="no-italics">Madame</span>

<p><i>Madame</i> (<i>severely</i>). Mr. Regniati.</p>

<p><i>The Signor</i> (<i>pretending extra sleepiness</i>). My dear! (<i>He
won't open his eyes.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Madame.</i> It is exactly a quarter past seven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111">111</a></span>
<i>The Signor</i> (<i>snuggling down into the pillow</i>). I vill not
be two me-neets. (<i>Disappears under bedclothes.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Madame</i> (<i>before the looking-glass, with her head bent well
forward, her hands behind her back, lacing herself into determination</i>).
Get up, Mr. Regniati. (<i>No sign of life in the bed.</i>)
Don't pretend to have gone to sleep again. (<i>Not a movement.</i>)
I know you haven't. I shan't wait for you when I'm once
dressed. It's twenty-five minutes. (<i>Sharply.</i>) Do you hear,
Mr. Regniati?</p>

<p><i>The Signor</i> (<i>re-appearing as far as the tip of his nose.

<p><i>Madame</i> (<i>backhairing energetically</i>). Fiddlesticks.</p>

<p><i>The Signor</i> (<i>in an injured tone</i>). Oh! Vy you say zat?
You know I do sof-far from my nose&mdash;and my head ache
all&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><i>Madame</i> (<i>coming to a dead stop in her toilette</i>). Mr.
Regniati, you eat and drink too much.</p>

<p><i>The Signor</i> (<i>as if horrified at lying under such an
imputation, but showing no disposition to rise with the
occasion</i>). Oh! My Jo! (<i>appealing to abstract justice in the
bed-curtains.</i>) Good-ness knows (<i>he pronounces it &#8216;Good-ness-knows&#8217;</i>)
I eat no-sing at-all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112">112</a></span>
<i>Madame</i> (<i>coming to the point</i>). Mr. Regniati, I can't
finish my dressing if you stop there.</p>

<p><i>The Signor</i> (<i>bestirring himself with as much dignity as is
possible under the circumstances</i>). I go. Vere is my leet-tel
slip-pers? (<i>Protesting</i>) I shall catch my dets of cold. (<i>He
finds them.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Madame.</i> Now, Mr. Regniati, make haste, or we shall be
late. (<i>Shuts his dressing-room door on him.</i>)</p>

<p>In about a quarter of an hour after this, the carriage is
announced, and the Signor is hurried down stairs.</p>

<p><i>The Signor</i> (<i>complaining</i>). Oh! I am so ongry. (<i>Procrastinating.</i>)
Ve 'ave time to take som-sing to eat, be-fore zat
ve&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><i>Madame</i> (<i>cutting him short</i>). Nonsense, Mr. Regniati. If
you wanted to stuff, you should have got up earlier.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Regniati.</i> Stoff! (<i>Protests.</i>) My Jo! I do not stoff!
(<i>Unhappily.</i>) I 'ave no-sing in&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><i>Madame</i> (<i>ascetically</i>). A little abstinence will do you good.
Come.</p>

<p><i>Exeunt Madame, attended by the Signor. Carriage drives
off.</i></p>

<p>Mrs. Orby Frimmely, whose new things came down yesterday&mdash;latest
Parisian mode&mdash;the two Misses Cherton, Miss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113">113</a></span>Medford, Captain Byrton, Chilvern, Cazell, are the Church
party.</p>

<p>Mr. Orby Frimmely, having been busy in the City all the
week, is what he calls &#8220;taking it out&#8221; in bed on Sunday
morning. He emphatically asserts his position (a horizontal
one), and with religious fervour claims Sunday as a day of
rest.</p>

<p>Being uncertain of the weather I remain at home with
Milburd.</p>

<p>Milburd shifts the responsibility on to my shoulders by
saying, &#8220;I'll go if you'll go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hesitation.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i> Wait and see what the weather is like.</p>

<p>At a quarter to eleven (service is at eleven) the weather is
like nothing particular.</p>

<p><i>10.50.</i> A gleam of sunshine. We watch it. The Signor, to
whom the weather is of consequence, as he intends walking to
the nearest farm on a visit of inspection to some rather fine
pigs, remarks, &#8220;It vill 'old-up. Ven de sun shine now, it
shine all day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Milburd doesn't think so. My opinion is that these rays are
treacherous.</p>

<p><i>10.55.</i> First appearance of genuine blue sky. Peal of bells
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114">114</a></span>stopped, and one only going now. The last call. More hesitation,
I ask Milburd what he thinks of it. Milburd, in an
arm-chair before fire and the &#8220;Field&#8221; newspaper in his hand,
says &#8220;that he doesn't know what to make of it.&#8221; Further
hesitation.</p>

<p><i>Eleven.</i> Cessation of all bells. Sudden silence everywhere.
Sky bright and blue. Sun out.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;If we'd only known this we might have
gone to church.</p>

<p><i>Milburd</i> (<i>from behind the &#8220;Field&#8221;</i>). &#8220;Yes. It's too late
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Signor has started with Jenkyns Soames (who is of some
philosophic form of religion, in which long walks and gymnastics
play leading parts), for the Piggeries.</p>

<p>Of Boodels nothing has been seen, or heard, since his first
message.</p>

<p>Mr. Orby Frimmely, under the impression that the ladies
have disappeared from the scene, descends in his lounging coat,
and breakfasts alone. After this he lights a cigar, and makes
himself useful in the conservatory.</p>

<p>Madame is walking in the garden, enjoying the winter sun's
warmth, and reading.</p>

<p>From my room I can see her. She comes pacing majestically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115">115</a></span>right underneath my window. Her book is the <i>Meditations of
Marcus Aurelius</i>.</p>

<p>Good notion for you. Sunday book. Nothing solemn.
Lightly contemplative. Will you? Wire back.</p>

<p>Forgot it's Sunday, and no telegrams can be sent. Very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117">117</a></span>absurd. Why shouldn't one want to send a telegram on
Sunday equally as much as on Monday? Telegraphic people
might arrange for holidays easily enough, by having small
extra Sunday staff.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Will commence my Meditations. Head
them <i>Sunday Sayings</i>. No, they're <i>not</i> sayings. Prefer
alliterative title. Try <i>Sunday Sighs</i>. But they're not sighs.
Try another, <i>Sunday Sermons</i>. No, they won't be sermons.
Put down a lot of titles and see which I like. <i>Sunday Songs.</i>
<i>Sobs for Sunday.</i> <i>Sunday Solids.</i> (This is something more
like it.) Or a double title. <i>Sunday Solids and Sunday
Suctions.</i> No; won't do.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Write the meditations first, see what they
come out like, and then give them a name. This will, so to
speak, &#8220;suit my book,&#8221; as to-morrow, with a name and everything
cut and dried, I can write particulars to Popgood and
Groolly.</p>

<p>For the nonce&mdash;(good word, by the way, &#8220;the nonce&#8221;)&mdash;only
it's always given me the idea of sounding like a
vague part of the body, where one could be hit or knocked
down. I mean it would never surprise me to hear that some
one had met a man and hit him on the nonce. Result
fatal.</p>

that he was killed by a blow on the nonce.&#8221;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left: 50%;"><i>Extract from local paper.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>To resume:&mdash;</p>

<p>For the nonce, I will head them merely for my own personal
information, &#8220;Sayings for Sunday.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then, all, in a monthly volume, as Medleys for the Month.
I distinctly see Popgood and Groolly's rapid and colossal fortune.
Then there'd be a quarterly. Why not <i>Quarterly Quips</i>? No,
this is not sufficiently general. [N.B. Joke by a man on a
treadmill might be termed a <i>Quip on a Crank</i>.]</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;<i>Quantity and Quality, a Quarterly
Quintessence.</i> <i>Quips, Quiddities, Quibbles, and Quirks</i>,

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;&#8220;<i>Quick Quills.</i>&#8221; Popgood's advertisement
will say, &#8220;The above Quarterly by Quick Quills.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now I'll begin.</p>

<p>Knock at the door. Mr. Orby Frimmely wants to know
if I will stroll out with him and meet the Signor returning.</p>

<p>With pleasure. Leave the sayings for another Sunday.</p>

<p>We stroll.</p>

<small>A WALK WITH SIGNOR REGNIATI.</small></h2>

<div class="chapter-summary"><p class="center"><i>THE PROSAIC GENTLEMAN.</i></p></div>


<p class="dropcap"><i>Weather fine. We are out for a walk. Mr. Orby
Frimmely, of the City, represents the Prosaic. I put
myself down as the Poetic, and the Signor as the Enthusiastic.
To us a small man in clerical black and Roman collar.</i></p>

<p><i>The Signor</i> (<i>saluting cleric</i>). Ah, Father Cuthbert. 'Ow
you do? (<i>Introduces us.</i>) You 'ave got beautiful flowers.</p>

<p><i>Father C.</i> (<i>alluding to the bunch in his hand</i>). <i>Flores martyrum.</i>
You have heard that we are ordered off for active
service in China.</p>

<p><i>Self.</i> China! (<i>We see in our &#8220;mind's eye, Horatio&#8221; the
fearful tortures recently practised upon Christians in China
and are speechless.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Frimmely</i> (<i>the Prosaic</i>). Ah! You must take care what
you're about there. (<i>Surprise of the Reverend F. Cuthbert.</i>)
The Government won't protect you, you know (<i>he says this as if
the reverend gentleman was going to China to rob an orchard</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121">121</a></span>
<i>Father C.</i> No. It will not. (<i>Nobly.</i>) We go to suffer and
to preach the faith.</p>

<p><i>Signor.</i> Oh, my Jo! I should not like to be eat. I 'ope
you vill not go. Let us know before you start.</p>

<p><i>Father C.</i> (<i>cheerfully</i>). It is certain. I'm afraid I shan't be
at the College to see you next Sunday. Good-bye.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit Father C.</i></p>

<p><i>We continue our walk.</i></p>

<p><i>Myself</i> (<i>the poetical</i>). Ah! What a grand lot! What a
high and holy calling. Here we are, striving for comfort, and
perhaps for fame, there the missioner goes forth, to die, perhaps
in torments, unknown to the world until the Day of Doom.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>I am impressed and silent.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Signor.</i> Oh, my Jo! I vould not go to be eat. (<i>Nobly,
and in true Christian spirit.</i>) I vould say let me go, and I
vill run a-vays.</p>

<p><i>Frimmely</i> (<i>the Prosaic</i>). Martyr!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, I wouldn't mind
being a martyr if I'd been brought up to it. I don't see why
you should waste sentiment on Father Cuthbert or anybody
else whose profession it is. (<i>Repeating incisively</i>) It's his
profession, his business, to be uncomfortable, and, finis coronat
opus, martyrdom signifies in his line, success. (<i>We are silent
and he continues further to instruct us.</i>) You Catholics (<i>to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122">122</a></span>the Signor</i>), you know, have colleges of Missioners in training;
I've seen 'em. As in a Law College there would be portraits of
Chief Justices and celebrated Q.C.'s in the costumes of their
rank, so in a Missioners' College you have pictures of Celebrated
Martyrs in the peculiar Costumes of their particular
torments. It's a regular business, with <i>you</i> I mean, not so much
with Protestants. We do it more comfortably. With us it's
rather a question of a foreign appointment, with a good income.</p>

<p><i>The Signor.</i> Vell&mdash;(<i>considering</i>). I am ongry. Let us go
an' eat some-sing.</p>

<div class="chapter-summary"><p class="center">A SUNDAY CONVERSATION.</p></div>


<p class="dropcap"><i class="first-word">Miss Adelaide</i> (<i>warming her toes on the fender before
sitting down to luncheon</i>). Oh, how cold it was in
Church.</p>

<p><i>Captain Byrton.</i> Wasn't it. Upon my word if they expect
people to go, they ought to keep the place warm.</p>

<p><i>Chilvern.</i> It was so cold I couldn't go to sleep during the
sermon (<i>knives and forks at work</i>).</p>

<p><i>Cazell.</i> It wasn't such a very bad sermon. Pickles, please!
Thanks.</p>

<p><i>Myself</i> (<i>showing some interest</i>). Who preached?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Frimmely.</i> I don't know his name. He wasn't here
last Sunday.</p>

<p><i>Boodels</i> (<i>whose headache has entirely disappeared</i>). Ah,
the Rector perhaps. There are two Churches here, and he has
two Curates.</p>

<p><i>Miss Bella</i> (<i>frowningly</i>). He preached in black.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124">124</a></span>
<i>Milburd.</i> It <i>is</i> the Rector. It's what they call &#8216;Low
Sunday&#8217; here.</p>

<p><i>Chilvern.</i> What's that?</p>

<p><i>Madame.</i> Not Low Sunday with us; that is after Easter
Day.</p>

<p><i>Medford</i> (<i>explaining</i>). Ah yes, Boodels refers to the tone
of their Churchmanship. The Rector is Broad Church, Mr.
Marveloe, the senior Curate, is High Church, and Mr. Alpely,
the junior Curate, is Low. This just suits the parishioners,
and they take it turn and turn about at the two Churches, the
Rector doing duty at both, accommodating himself to either
view as the case may be. One Sunday they're high, another
they're low, and the other Church is <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.</p>

<p><i>Miss Adelaide.</i> To-day it was the duett of parson and
clerk.</p>

<p><i>Miss Bella.</i> Oh, horrid! I'd rather stop at home than hear
that. Why at S. Phillips at home we have vestments, and
incense, and everything is done so well.</p>

<p><i>Miss Medford</i> (<i>quietly</i>). Well, I'd just as soon go to
one as another. May I trouble you for the salt, Signor
Regniati?</p>

<p><i>Signor.</i> My Jo! If zey do not preach I vould go&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Madame</i> (<i>severely</i>). Mr. Regniati, hand the salt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125">125</a></span>
<i>Mrs. Frimmely.</i> What an absurd cloak that Mrs. Tringmer
had.</p>

<p><i>Miss Bella.</i> I suppose she thought it was quite the fashion.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Frimmely.</i> Who was that lady&mdash;Captain Byrton, do
<i>you</i> know?&mdash;who came in rustling all up the Church, and so
scented! as if she'd stepped out of a perfumer's.</p>

<p><i>Byrton.</i> Don't know. Perhaps she <i>has</i> stepped out of a
perfumer's, and is an advertisement.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought (for a perfumer).</i>&mdash;To send scented people
about. Questions asked, <i>e.g.</i> Stranger (<i>sniffing</i>) goes up
politely and inquires, &#8220;I beg a hundred pardons, but what
scent&mdash;what delicious scent are you wearing?&#8221; Then the
lady replies, &#8220;Don't mention it, Ma'am. It's (whatever the
name is), and there's the card.&#8221; And gives her the perfumer's
address.</p>

<p><i>Miss Adelaide.</i> I thought Miss Vyner rather prettily
dressed.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Frimmely.</i> Oh! but <i>did</i> you see her gloves! Such
a fit!</p>

<p><i>Miss Bella.</i> And such a colour!</p>

<p><i>Cazell.</i> I wonder who that bald-headed man in front of me
was? There was a collection, and he put a sovereign into the
plate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126">126</a></span>
<i>Chilvern.</i> I'm always unlucky in that way. Whenever I go
to Church there's always a collection.</p>

<p><i>Captain Byrton.</i> Yes. You kept the man waiting at the
pew door for at least two minutes, while you fumbled in all
your pockets. Anyone have any cheese?</p>

<p><i>Chilvern.</i> I knew I'd got a shilling somewhere&mdash;but it was
a fourpenny-bit after all.</p>

<p><i>Miss Medford.</i> How very disturbing it must be for the
clergyman, when a child persists in crying at intervals all
through the sermon.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Frimmely.</i> Yes, little things like that oughtn't to be
brought to church; at least, not to sit out sermons.</p>

<p><i>Boodels</i> (<i>with some vague recollection of the baptismal
service</i>). But you forget, Mrs. Frimmely, godfathers and godmothers
promise to bring children to <i>hear</i> sermons. That's one
of the three things they vow in the child's name.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Frimmely.</i> Really? (<i>seeing no help for it short of a
second reformation, or disestablishment</i>). Well it's a great
pity.</p>

<p><i>Milburd</i> (<i>to Byrton</i>). I see by the <i>Field</i> to-day, that
<i>Lysander</i> is going up for the Derby.</p>

<p><i>Byrton.</i> He's nowhere. <i>Corkscrew's</i> at a hundred to
fifteen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127">127</a></span>
<i>Mrs. Frimmely.</i> I was right last year. Wasn't I? (<i>To her
husband.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Frimmely.</i> Yes: for once. (<i>Mrs. Frimmely tosses her
head.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Soames</i> (<i>the Professor of Scientific Economy</i>). Betting can
be reduced to the certainty of a mathematical calculation.</p>

<p><i>Cazell</i> (<i>to him</i>). I tell you what <i>you</i> ought to do, then.</p>

<p><i>Soames</i> (<i>innocently</i>). What?</p>

<p><i>Cazell.</i> Make your fortune. (<i>A titter. Pause.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Medford.</i> I see by the <i>Musical Times</i> that we're to have
the new prima donna, Stellafanti, at Covent Garden.</p>

<p><i>Madame.</i> We heard her years ago at Naples. (<i>Interest in
her diminishes.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Frimmely.</i> We <i>must</i> get up some theatricals here.</p>

<p><i>Misses Adelaide and Bella.</i> Oh yes, <i>do let's</i>!</p>

<p><i>Miss Medford.</i> I think they <i>are</i> such fun.</p>

<p><i>Medford.</i> We could do something musical, easily.</p>

<p><i>The Signor</i> (<i>while the others talk about theatricals</i>). My
Jo! I should like to get a leettel shoot vile I am here.</p>

<p><i>Capt Byrton.</i> Birds very wild. Have you had good sport?</p>

<p><i>Signor.</i> My Jo! at Bad-ge-bee zere are&mdash;oh&mdash;'eaps of birds!
but ven zey see me, zey go avays. I go out to shoot zem, an' I
shoot no-sing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128">128</a></span>
Here the conversation becomes general, some are hot on
theatricals and musical matters, others on sporting. Mr. Frimmely
and the Professor are discussing finance. Miss Medford
and Mrs. Regniati have got on an ecclesiastical topic.</p>

<p>&mdash;&#8220;We might play an opera, with a part for&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&mdash;&#8220;The Archbishop of Canterbury, he is a friend of our rector's
and says&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&mdash;&#8220;My Jo! I 'ave such a pig! and I 'ave a bull that&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&mdash;&#8220;With skates on! in a frost&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&mdash;&#8220;Will win the Derby, I'll back him unless he's&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&mdash;&#8220;Dressed as a brigand. Charming! or else as&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&mdash;&#8220;A simple sum in arithmetic&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&mdash;&#8220;With a red nose&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&mdash;&#8220;In the organ-loft. But he objected to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&mdash;&#8220;Cold cream the only thing! put that on first, and then&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&mdash;&#8220;You may get within a few yards of the birds, they won't
hear you, and when they're&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&mdash;&#8220;Paying ten per cent. for your money. Why not leave it&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&mdash;&#8220;On the top of your head with a feather&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&mdash;&#8220;Or go up in the pulpit before the sermon, as the rector
did&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&mdash;&#8220;In a transparency; it's easily managed by&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&mdash;&#8220;Another tax on the Spanish coupons&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129">129</a></span>
&mdash;&#8220;And a bath every evening with&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p class="dropcap"><i class="first-word">First.</i>&mdash;Of the bee. If the
bee could talk, he would
always be boasting of his
business, and would do
nothing.</p>

<p><i>Moral.</i>&mdash;Learn then
from the bee, the lesson
of silent perseverance.</p>

<p>(I think this <i>is</i> the
lesson to be learnt.)</p>

<p><i>Second.</i>&mdash;The wasp's
sting is in its tail. So is
a tale-bearer's.</p>

<p><i>Moral.</i>&mdash;Avoid wasps and tale-bearers.</p>

<p>(This would come among the quips. Still I think it would be
a fair Sunday quip, for even a serious circle.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131">131</a></span>
<i>Third.</i>&mdash;Stand by Niagara Falls, and abuse them. The
falls will go on the same as ever. Throw mud at them.
None will stick. The power of pure water will wash it
away.</p>

<p><i>Moral.</i>&mdash;A spotless character is protected by its own integrity,
and though men will try to defame it, yet it triumphs in
the end.</p>

<p>(Don't care about this moral. Get something better out of it
before to-morrow. It will do for &#8220;<i>material</i>.&#8221;)</p>

<p><i>Fourth.</i>&mdash;We are born for the sake of one another.</p>

<p><i>Moral.</i>&mdash;Find out for whom you were born, and stick to him,
or her.</p>

<p>(Rather a frisky moral this. More for Mondays than
Sundays, perhaps. Marcus Aurelius was a great man. One
begins to appreciate the greatness of a maxim-maker or
aphorist, when you try to do something in that line
yourself.)</p>

<p><i>Fifth.</i>&mdash;You yourself are often like those who offend
you.</p>

<p><i>Moral.</i>&mdash;When you detect the resemblance to yourself in
others, treat them as you deserve to be treated. This may
lead to difficulties.</p>

<p>(Something suggested here, by this last word.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132">132</a></span>
<i>Sixth.</i>&mdash;Difficulties were made to be surmounted.</p>

<p><i>Moral.</i>&mdash;Go up Mount Ararat and down the other
side.</p>

<p><i>Seventhly.</i>&mdash;The sum of social Christianity: Love your
neighbour, and hate your relations.</p>

<p>(This will do for Sunday. Irony for Sunday. Fun for
Friday <i>&agrave; propos</i> of irony. Who ought to have been the best
writer of <i>irony</i>? <i>Steele.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Eighthly.</i>&mdash;In a woman's youth, coquetry is natural. It is
the expression of amiable indecision. At thirty, it is a
science.</p>

<p>(Somehow I think, I've slid away from Sunday literature.)</p>

<p><i>Ninthly.</i>&mdash;A pretty woman well &#8220;made up&#8221; is an angel .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
with false wings.</p>

<p>(The mention of an angel, is something nearer to
Sunday.)</p>

<p><i>Tenthly.</i>&mdash;'Tis curious that when the Jews finish, the
Christians begin. Their Sabbath is the last day of the week,
our Sunday is the first.</p>

<p>(This is more like what I wanted. Only in the last three
instances, there has been no moral.)</p>

<p><i>&Agrave; propos</i> of a moral.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133">133</a></span>
<i>Eleventhly.</i>&mdash;A moral in a fable is like the hook in the
bait.</p>

<p><i>Moral</i>.&mdash;Take the bait .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and leave the hook.</p>

<p><i>Twelfthly.</i>&mdash;&#8220;The Devil,&#8221; said Voltaire, &#8220;is at the bottom
of Christianity. Without the Devil Christianity would
not be.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ah, but the Devil little thought this when he tempted
Eve.</p>

<p>There is no particular moral to this. It does not require
one.</p>

<p><i>Thirteenthly.</i>&mdash;The bad man who attends to the convenances
of religious observance, only puts polish on muddy
boots.</p>

<p><i>Moral.</i>&mdash;Clean your boots.</p>

<p>(Might add also, &#8220;take care of the puddles.&#8221; Popgood and
Groolly will make a fortune of such a Sunday book as I am
getting together. Only it will take some time to compile two
hundred pages of maxims and morals.)</p>

<p><i>Fourteenthly.</i>&mdash;Stars and pretty women at a ball don't show
to advantage by daylight.</p>

<p><i>Moral.</i>&mdash;Go to bed early.</p>

<p><i>Fifteenthly.</i>&mdash;(<i>A pendant</i>). The Moon is pale from being
up all night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134">134</a></span>
<i>Moral.</i>&mdash;Same as preceding.</p>

<p><i>Sixteenthly.</i>&mdash;Marrying for Love is like digging for gold. It
is to be hoped the speculation will succeed.</p>

<p><i>Moral.</i>&mdash;Love in haste: marry at leisure.</p>

<p>(Altogether, I fancy, I'm wandering from Sunday Meditations.
I don't think these are the jottings of Marcus
Aurelius.)</p>

<p><i>Seventeenthly.</i>&mdash;Here is something specially for Sunday:&mdash;</p>

<p>If you can't pay creditors, love them. It may not be exactly
fulfilling the law of your country, but the sentiment is sublime
and thoroughly Christian.</p>

<p>(This is a moral in itself. <i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Make a moral
first and invent the fable. Good.)</p>

<p><i>Eighteenthly</i>.&mdash;We are all so vain that we can't imagine
eternal happiness too much for us. The reverse of the medal is
unpalatable.</p>

<p><i>Moral.</i>&mdash;Be 'umble.</p>

<p><i>Nineteenthly.</i>&mdash;There are few men, if any, with whom it is
possible to reason concerning either Love or Religion.</p>

<p><i>Moral.</i>&mdash;Don't try.</p>

<p><i>Twentiethly.</i>&mdash;Theological discussion generally comes in after
dinner with the third bottle of wine.</p>

<p><i>Moral.</i>&mdash;Get to the fourth as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135">135</a></span>
<i>Twenty-onethly.</i>&mdash;Life is a perpetual Epitaph.</p>

<p><i>Moral.</i>&mdash;Better than most epitaphs, because it's short. If
you've got to write one remember this.</p>

<p>The last is so melancholy that I can only sit down and think.
At present this will do for my Sunday Meditations.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="first-word">For</span> some days Milburd, Mrs. Orby Frimmely, Cazell, Chilvern,
and the Medfords have been working hard at a new piece.</p>

<p>The order of the evening is dinner for a few, then theatricals
to amuse the many, then refreshments, then a dance, and
finally supper.</p>

<p>The Signor is in great force.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; he says to his wife, &#8220;I shall do my lit-tel step.
I shall valse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Regniati,&#8221; returns Madame, severely, &#8220;you will do
nothing of the sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>This rather damps his ardour; and the fact of being unable
to consult his nephew on the best means of obtaining his chance
of doing his &#8220;lit-tel steps,&#8221; still further depresses him.</p>

<p>He is perpetually looking into the theatre-room, and as often
begging pardon, and being turned out.</p>

<p>The night arrives. I receive the guests as president, and
I take the lady I don't want to in to dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137">137</a></span>
Dinner successful.</p>

<p>Madame rises at the proper moment; and after an hour, and
the arrival of several carriages full, the gong summons us to the
theatre.</p>

<p>Here Medford and myself hand round the programmes, and
Miss Medford performs on the piano.</p>

<p>The programmes are in her writing too. Most neatly done.</p>

<p>Phew! I'm only gradually cooling. This is the sixth day
I've taken the waters of Aix-la-Chapelle .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I'm beginning
to be so sulphurous all over, that, if anybody was to rub against
me suddenly, I should ignite and go off with a bang. I've
written to my friend Box an account of it. I haven't seen Box
for some years; but as I particularly wish him to remain in
England just now, I've commenced a correspondence with him.
I've told him that the doctor's orders here are very simple .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
&#8220;Herr Cox,&#8221; says he to me&mdash;Herr's German&mdash;I must explain
that to Box, because, though Box is a good fellow, yet&mdash;he's&mdash;in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141">141</a></span>fact&mdash;he's an ass. &#8220;Herr Cox,&#8221; says he, &#8220;you must drink a
glass of sulphur wasser.&#8221; Wasser's German too; it didn't take
long for my naturally fine intellect to discover that it meant
water. But Box doesn't know it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for though he's an excellent
fellow, he is&mdash;in fact he's an ignoramus. &#8220;Herr Cox,&#8221;
says he to me, &#8220;you must take the sulphur wasser, and then
walk about.&#8221; &#8220;What next, Herr Doctor?&#8221; says I. Note to
Box. <i>Herr Doctor</i> doesn't mean that he's anything to do
with a <i>Hair</i>-cutter. No, it's the respectful German for
Mister&mdash;must explain that to Box, for though he's a tiptop
chap, yet Box is&mdash;is&mdash;in fact, Box is a confounded idiot.
&#8220;Herr Doctor,&#8221; says I, &#8220;what next?&#8221; &#8220;Well,&#8221; says he
&#8220;when you've taken the sulphur water and walked about,
then you must walk about and take the sulphur water.&#8221;
Simple. The first glass .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ugh! I shan't forget it. I
never could have imagined, till that moment, what the
taste of a summer beverage made of curious old eggs .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a
trifle over ripe .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. beaten up with a lucifer match, would be
like .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. now I know. But I was not to be conquered. Glass
number two was not so bad. Glass number three .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. less
unpalatable than glass number two&mdash;glass number four .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
um, between number three and number four a considerable
time was allowed to elapse, as I found I had been going it too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142">142</a></span>fast. But now my enfeebled health is gradually being renovated,
and they tell me that when I leave this, I shall be &#8220;quite
another man.&#8221; I don't know what other man I shall be.
Yes I do. I am now a single man. I hope to leave here a
double, I mean a married man. Cox, my boy, that's what
you've come here for. Cox, my boy, that's why you want to
keep, diplomatically, Box, my boy, in England, and in ignorance
of your proceedings. Herr Cox, you're a sly dog. If I
could give myself a dig in the ribs without any internal injury,
I'd do it. I came here for the rheumatism. By the way I
needn't have come here for <i>that</i>, as I'd got it pretty strongly.
I caught it, without any sort of trouble. I bathed, at Margate,
in the rain. Before I could reach my bathing machine, I was
drenched through and through, I don't know where to, but long
beyond the skin. The injury was more than skin deep. No
amount of exterior scrubbings could cure me. Brandies and
waters hot internally, every day for two months, produced
more than the desired effect. I began to wander. I finished
by travelling. And here I am. In six more lessons on the
sulphur spring, I shall be quite the Cure. (<i>Dances and sings.</i>)

sat. Radiant as ever. A widow for the second time. Originally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145">145</a></span>widow of William Wiggins, of Margate and Ramsgate, and
now widow of Nathaniel Knox, of the Docks, with a heap&mdash;a
perfect heap&mdash;of money. Then my old passion returned.
I determined to propose to her. I was about to do so, when
on the very morning that I was going to throw myself at her
feet, I caught this infernal rheumatism, which laid me on
my back. When I recovered she was gone. &#8220;Where to?&#8221;
says I. &#8220;Aix!&#8221; says they. My spirits mounted. I took a vast
amount of pains to get to Aix, and here I am. I had heard of
some property in Venice, which belonged to the Coxes some
hundreds of years ago, and so I thought I'd join pleasure with
business, and take Aix and Penelope Anne on the road. And
now <i>here</i> she is. If Box had only known it, he'd have been
after her. He's a first-rate fellow, is Box, but abominably
mercenary and mean. He'd think nothing of proposing to
Penelope Anne merely for her money. And <i>I</i> think nothing
of a man who could do such a thing. So I've written to Box
telling him to go to the North, and I'll come and stay with him
for the shooting season. A little shooting Box in Scotland.
Ha! ha! when I <i>do</i> go, it will be with Penelope Anne on my
arm, as Mr. and Mrs. Cox. Let me see, when the hour strikes
again, it will be time for my third tumbler&mdash;here it is&mdash;and the
promenade. The Doctor says I must be punctual in drinking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146">146</a></span>the water, so I'll put myself straight, and then, so to speak, lay
myself out for the capture of Penelope Anne.</p>

BOX.</p>

<p>We know what we are, but we never know what we shall be.
I am not quite clear at present, by the way, what I am, let
alone what I <i>shall</i> be. If anybody three months ago had said
to me, &#8220;Box, my boy, you are a grandee of Spain&#8221; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I should
have said that he was a .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in point of fact I shouldn't have
believed him. But still I am&mdash;that is, partially so&mdash;I'm gradually
becoming one. At present I'm only half a grandee. Three
months ago a friend, my legal adviser, a law stationer's senior
clerk, near Chancery Lane, said to me, &#8220;Box, my boy, you've
got Spanish blood in you.&#8221; I said that I had suspected as
much from my peculiar and extreme partiality for the
vegetable called a Spanish onion, and I was going to a doctor,
when my friend and legal adviser said to me, &#8220;Box, my boy,
I don't mean <i>that</i>. I mean that your great grandmother
was of Spanish extraction.&#8221; I replied that I had heard that
they had extracted my great grandmother from that quarter,
&#8220;I came across some papers,&#8221; continued my legal adviser,
&#8220;which allude to her as Donna Isidora y Caballeros, Carvalhos
y Cazadores y Regalias, Salamanca, Spain, who married
John Box, trader, of Eliza Lane, St. Margaret's Wharf,
Wapping. Date and all correct. Go,&#8221; says he&mdash;I mean my
legal adviser&mdash;&#8220;go to Spain, and claim your title, your estates,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150">150</a></span>and your money, and I'll stand in with you, and take half the
profits.&#8221; I was struck by this remarkably handsome offer, and
went down to Margate to cultivate a Spanish moustache and
think about it. Whenever I want to think about anything
deeply, I go down to Margate. Well, one morning as I was
examining the progress of my moustache, after shaving my chin
and letting out some of the blue blood of the Hidalgos in a
most tremendous gash, judge of my astonishment, when, walking
on the beach, in among the donkeys and the Ethiopian serenaders,
I saw in widow's weeds, as majestic as ever, Penelope Anne!
(<i>Sings</i>) &#8220;I saw her for a moment, but methinks I see her now,
with the wreath of&mdash;something or other&mdash;upon her&mdash;something
brow&#8221;&mdash;&mdash;and then I lost sight of her. But my Spanish
blood was up. The extraction from the sunny South boiled in
my veins .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. boiled over, when I learnt, on referring to the
visitors' list, that Penelope Anne was the relict of the short-breath'd&mdash;I
mean short-lived but virtuous&mdash;Knox, who had left
her his entire fortune. All my long-stifled passion returned&mdash;the
passion which the existence of a Wiggins, her first, had not
quenched, which the ephemeral life of a Knox had not extinguished,
a passion which I have felt for her before I knew that
the blue ink&mdash;I mean the blue blood, of the Hidalgos danced
in my veins, and while she was only a sweet village maiden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151">151</a></span>eighteen years old, and known to all as Miss Penelope Anne,
of Park Place, Pimlico! I determined to go out and throw
myself at her feet, declare my passion, and take nothing
for an answer except &#8220;Box .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. John .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I'm yours truly,
Penelope!&#8221; I couldn't present myself before her with a
scrubbing-brush on my upper lip. So that afternoon I
sacrificed Mars to Venus&mdash;I mean I shaved off my moustache
for the sake of Penelope Anne. The next morning .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Toothache wasn't the name for what I suffered. Face-ache
fails to describe my agonies. Neuralgia doesn't give the
faintest idea of my tortures. The left side of my face looked
exactly as if I was holding a large dumpling in my mouth, or
a gigantic ribston-pippin which I couldn't swallow. Swallow!
Not a bit of food passed these lips, except slops, beef-tea, and
tea without the beef, for days. At the end of a week I was a
shadow. Penelope Anne had gone. Where, no one knew.
Somebody said they thought it was the Continent. I bought
a map and looked out the Continent, but it wasn't in that. I
suppose it was an old edition&mdash;there have been so many
changes, and they're building everywhere&mdash;so I consulted my
medical man and my legal adviser. The first said, &#8220;Get change
of air. Go abroad!&#8221; The second said, &#8220;Seize the opportunity
and go to Spain. And,&#8221; he added, &#8220;come home by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152">152</a></span>Continent.&#8221; That suited me down to the ground. I should get
my title, my lands, and my money, meeting Penelope Anne on
the Continent. As I was coming back I should be able to offer
her the hand and heart of either Don Jos&eacute; John de Boxos y
Cazadores y Regalias y Caballeros y Carvalhos of Salamanca,
Spain, or of plain John Box, of Barnsbury. So here I am. I
haven't got the whole title yet, as the Spanish legal gentleman
and I didn't hit it off exactly.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If I'd only known what he
was talking about, it would have shortened the proceedings.
However, as that remark applies to all legal business, I couldn't
quarrel with a foreigner on that point. Besides, if you quarrel
with a Spaniard, his southern blood can't stand it. He stabs
you. He's sorry for it afterwards, but that's his noble nature.
So I've adopted half the title, and the rest will be sent on to me
if the suit is gained. But up to this moment I've not met
Penelope Anne. I've had so much of the wines of Spain, that
my medical man wrote and advised me to try the waters of
Germany. So here I am. (<i>Takes up paper</i>). What's this?

of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; um, um. (<i>reads</i>) &#8220;<i>Spain on the eve of a crisis.</i>&#8221; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
There were three while I was there. Nobody took any notice
of them. What's this? &#8220;Hotel der Schwein and die Pfeife&#8221;&mdash;that's

My dear Mrs. Frimmely, I've been saying to your

<p><i>Mrs. Orby Frimmely</i> (<i>thinks that <em class="no-italics">his</em> opinion, at all events,

<p><i>Mr. Muntson</i> (<i>sees that he has created a most favourable impression
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184">184</a></span>and continues</i>). It was delightful. All the vivacity of
the French stage&mdash;of course you know the French stage well?&mdash;(<i>Mrs.
Frimmely nods. She has seen Schneider in &#8220;La

(<i>Mrs. Frimmely makes a little curtsey. Elderly Mr. Muntson
thinks that Mr. Frimmely is quite out of the race now that
he has stept in. He goes on.</i>) We have no actresses now&mdash;and
if you went on to the stage it would simply be a
triumph.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Frimmely</i> (<i>gradually becoming convinced as to what
<em class="no-italics">her</em> vocation in life certainly ought to be</i>). But this little
part I played to-night .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it is nothing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You can't judge
from that.</p>

<p><i>Muntson.</i> I can, perfectly. I have seen&mdash;let me see&mdash;I recollect
Mrs. Humby and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<i>Medford</i> (<i>in a corner with Myself; he gives me his private
opinion</i>). The piece would never have gone down without the
music.</p>

<p><i>Myself</i> (<i>rather pooh-poohing it all</i>). No .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of course
not.</p>

<p>Having neither acted nor appeared in any way, except
as representative host to do the honours, which, I find,
did themselves easily, I am a little bitter. Nobody
knew exactly who I was, nor seemed to take any
interest in me at all, except old Mrs. Frampton, who
thought I was a waiter, and asked me to order her carriage
punctually.</p>

<p><i>Medford.</i> Milburd is <i>so</i> obstinate. You know at first he
wouldn't introduce those tunes.</p>

<p><i>Myself.</i> (<i>Who want to go and talk to Ada Cherton.</i>)
Wouldn't he?</p>

<p><i>Medford.</i> No. (<i>With the air of a genuine critic.</i>) Milburd
couldn't touch Cox. Not his line at all. Between ourselves,
Chilvern was best as the Waiter.</p>

<p><i>Myself</i> (<i>decidedly</i>). Oh, a long way. (<i>This is because
he was an unimportant character comparatively. With very
little to do, that little he did as if it wasn't in a play at all, but
merely a bit of fun with the audience.</i>)</p>

piece for all of us. (<i>He sees himself in some particular
character.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Medford.</i> Yes (<i>reflectively</i>), we might easily do&mdash;let me see&mdash;there's
the <i>Game of Speculation</i>.</p>

it (<i>I add as a hit at Medford</i>) admirably; and (<i>to crush him

<p><i>Medford</i> (<i>tolerantly</i>). Yes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Charley (<i>he never met this
excellent comedian, of course; but this is Medford all over</i>) has
got some good &#8220;business&#8221; in the piece .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but (<i>diffidently</i>)

him. For instance, when, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="first-word">Captain Byrton</span> is out hunting. The
Signor and Milburd are out shooting.
Mrs. Frimmely is out walking with
Medford and Cazell. Miss Adelaide
Cherton and her sister are in the garden
with Chilvern and Boodels. Miss Medford
is trying some new music. Madame
is seated by the drawing-room fire, engaged
upon some mysterious wool-work, which may eventuate
in a cigar-case, slippers, a banner fire-screen, or a pair of fancy-pattern'd
braces for the Signor. Jenkyns Soames is supposed to
be in his room writing something on &#8220;Numbers,&#8221; but whether in
refutation of Dr. Colenso's later Pentateuchical views, or in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199">199</a></span>support of his earlier Arithmetical treatises, nobody has inquired,
and nobody, particularly, cares.</p>

<p>I am engaged very busily in thinking. It occurs to me that
I will join Miss Medford in the morning-room. There are some
days when one finds it very difficult to immediately follow
thoughts with action. On such occasions time doesn't fly, but
slides noiselessly down an inclined plane, and one is in a state of
perpetual surprise.</p>

<p><i>Surprise the first.</i>&mdash;You wake and are surprised to find it so
early.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Go to sleep again.</p>

<p>You turn round, snuggle down, and snooze. A mere snooze
until they call you. It being their duty to call you, let 'em do
it manfully, and you'll do yours.</p>

<p><i>Second Surprise.</i>&mdash;To awake again. Later than you <ins title="had had">had</ins>
expected. Must get up.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;No use getting up, though, until you've been
properly called, and the hot water's there. Besides, you'll be the
only one down. Employ the time, until the servant comes, in
<i>thinking</i>. Think what you'll do to-day. Think what you'll do first.
Put things in order in your mind, then when you get up you'll
only have to do them one after the other, and there you are&mdash;or
there you will be. Excellent plan, this. These arrangements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200">200</a></span>being satisfactorily made mentally, you suddenly find yourself
very warm, and then very wakeful, so much so that
it is a</p>

<p><i>Third Surprise</i>&mdash;on looking at your watch again&mdash;to
find that it's an hour since you last consulted it. Odd.
You <i>must</i> have been to sleep again. Very odd. And
&#8220;it's too bad of them;&#8221; (of course) they've never called
you.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Ring the bell for some one to come and
call me.</p>

<p>If the bell is by the bed, this is simple. If it isn't, certain
arrangements are as necessary as if you were going to make
a journey. Inquiries, as it were, concerning the route from
the bed to the bell-pull have to be made. This ascertained,
and the exact line you have to travel being now clear
before you, it is evident that you cannot be so venturesome
as to attempt the excursion without your slippers and dressing-gown.</p>

<p>Here commence man&oelig;uvres to obtain both articles, while
incurring the smallest possible danger of catching the slightest
possible cold, or chill.</p>

<p>Then after a series of gymnastic efforts, during which you
have nearly begun your day out of bed on your head, you are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201">201</a></span>successful. It is then requisite to pause and take breath. This
cessation of energy affords an opportunity for the servant to
appear with your hot water, without your inconveniencing
yourself any further.</p>

<p>However he doesn't come, and so you get out. Here the
freshening breeze which blows over the threshold, under the
door, and across the carpet, causes you, for one second, to
hesitate, and then foreseeing that the longer you stop out, <i>en
deshabille</i>, the worse it would be, you take precautions for the
future, inspired by a</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;&#8220;Cover the bed up carefully, so that it
will be warm when I come back again.&#8221; Aha! Then to the
bell-pull.</p>

<p><i>Fourth Surprise.</i>&mdash;Odd. You had never noticed before, that
this, which you thought was the bell-rope, is nothing of the
sort; being a cord attached to the old-fashioned catch on
the door, and originally hung within reach of the bed, which
was of course in exactly the opposite position to where it is
now. Where <i>is</i> the bell? You cannot see the rope anywhere.
Bother.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;To trace the wire running round the room
at the top.</p>

<p>You <i>do</i> trace it. It goes out at a hole and disappears.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202">202</a></span>Trace it back again. It goes all round, and as there
is no sign of a bell-rope, this article must be behind the
bed.</p>

<p>It is. Struggle with heavy bedstead. Dust. There at last
is the bell-rope. You pull it. You pull it again. You hear it
ring. This is satisfactory.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Get into bed again. Do so. Warm.
Arrange mentally for reprimanding the servant severely. Such
a waste of time. Here you have been awake since, goodness
knows when, and no hot water, no clothes, nothing! And you
may add, you put 'em outside the door so carefully last night, <i>on
purpose</i> that they shouldn't be forgotten.</p>

<p>Knock at door. &#8220;Come in.&#8221; Door shaken.</p>

<p><i>Fifth Surprise.</i>&mdash;Why doesn't he come in?&mdash;&mdash;Door shaken
again. Angrily, &#8220;Come in!&#8221;</p>

<p>Answer from outside, like the voice in a ventriloquist's
entertainment, &#8220;I can't come in, sir; the door's
locked.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Yourself</i> (in bed).&mdash;&#8220;No, it isn't. Push it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Answer from without, as before, &#8220;No, sir, you've let down the
latch. If you pull the string, I can come in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nuisance. Out of bed again. Pull up latch-string. Into
bed again. Less warm now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203">203</a></span>
<i>Yourself</i> (<i>or myself, severely, from bed</i>).&mdash;&#8220;You didn't call
me this morning. And where are my things?&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Valet.</i>&mdash;&#8220;They've been standing houtside, sir, this 'our and
a 'arf. I knocked twice, sir, but the latch was down, and so I
couldn't get in. 'Ot water, sir, 's cold as hice. Better bring
you some fresh.&#8221;</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p>There's still an entr'acte between his bringing the hot water
and my getting up.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Well, I dare say it's all the better for
me that I've overslept myself a little this morning. If
Nature sleeps, depend upon it Nature knows what she's
about.</p>

<p class="center" style="letter-spacing: 4.5em; margin-right: -4.5em;">*****</p>

<p>This is in fact how it has happened that all the others, except
the three mentioned, are out of doors. They've breakfasted
hours ago. I haven't.</p>

<hr style="visibility: hidden; margin: 1.5em;" />

<p>Madame Regniati puts down her work, looks towards the
window, through which we can see the garden-party, and
then refers to me inquisitively. Presently she asks mysteriously,</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see anything going on here?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204">204</a></span>
I can't help returning with, &#8220;Here, Madame Regniati!
where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she replies, in her short way, &#8220;<i>you</i> see it, I know
you do. Even Mr. Regniati has noticed it to me. For my
part,&#8221; she adds, rubbing her nose with the tip of a long
knitting-pin, &#8220;I think it's a case.&#8221;</p>

<p>I begin to understand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Adelaide&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; I venture.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 238px;">
<img src="images/p0204-image.png" width="238" height="190" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>&#8220;Yes. And with whom, eh?&#8221; she asks, with her head a
little on one side, and her thin lips compressed, as if she had got
the information on the tip of her tongue, and was preventing its
escape by sheer force.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; I begin, thinking to myself it's very odd I haven't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205">205</a></span>noticed it, &#8220;well, I should say&#8221;&mdash;really, I shouldn't say anything.</p>

<p>Madame nods at me. &#8220;Come,&#8221; she says; &#8220;I know you've
got penetration. You're an observer of character. You're a
thinker. My nephew has told me you're writing a philosophical
work. Now, I want you to lend me your sagacity, and confirm
my suspicions.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Look sagacious. Smile in deprecation of
too much sagacity. I feel that, being right as far as mentioning
Miss Adelaide goes, my next guess will probably be wrong.
Risk it.</p>

<p>I say, &#8220;Miss Adelaide and Cazell, eh?&#8221; (They are walking
together.)</p>

<p>Madame shakes her head. I have gone down in her estimation,
evidently.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;To assume my own penetration. Say to
Madame, &#8220;Ah, well, you'll see&#8221;&mdash;meaning, you'll find I'm right
and you're wrong.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; she replies. &#8220;Mr. Cazell and Miss Bella, Mr.
Chilvern and Miss Adelaide.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H'm,&#8221; I say, dubiously. Madame Regniati, classical, lover
of high art as she is, is, when occasion offers, is simply a match-maker.
I believe it's a feminine instinct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206">206</a></span>
&#8220;They've both got money,&#8221; she adds. She has summed it all
up, and arranged it.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="first-word">This</span> weighs on
my mind. I
can't help looking
from one
to the other&mdash;from
Chilvern
to Miss Adelaide,
from Miss
Bella to Cazell.</p>

<p>Milburd is
more attentive
to the latter
than Chilvern,
who seems to me to be making up to Miss Medford, if to anyone;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208">208</a></span>while Byrton sits next to Miss Bella at dinner, and monopolizes
her entirely.</p>

<p>Sly things <i>are</i> passing; I notice <i>that</i>. As President, I
have to sit at the head of the table, and can't join in any
of the fun. They have got a joke among them that I can't
make out. The joke flies about, like an invisible shuttlecock,
between Cazell, Miss Adelaide, Chilvern, Miss Bella, and
Byrton.</p>

<p>Jenkyns Soames sits on my right, and <i>will</i> talk arithmetic
and science to me.</p>

<p>The Medfords and the Frimmelys make another joke-party
as it were, and I cannot understand what's going
on.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Look as if I did. Smile, nod, say &#8220;I
know.&#8221; Milburd asks, almost rudely, &#8220;<i>Do</i> you? What
is it?&#8221; As I don't, I merely smile again, and say &#8220;Yes&#8221;
to Jenkyns Soames, who is giving me his reasons for supposing,
by calculation, that vegetables have had a pre-adamite
existence, and that even a turnip may have a glorious future
before it, when man has disappeared from the face of the
earth.</p>

<p>[I shall protest against my term of office being protracted
beyond the five weeks, after Christmas, that I undertook to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209">209</a></span>stop here. Three have expired. I begin to hate Jenkyns
Soames.]</p>

<p>A servant brings in a card for Mr. Milburd.</p>

<p class="center" style="border: 2px solid black; padding: 1em; width: 8em; margin: 2em auto 2em auto;">Baron Booteljak.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; exclaims Milburd, &#8220;I <i>am</i> so glad. That's
capital.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everyone puzzled.</p>

<p><i>The Signor</i> (<i>after reading the card</i>).&mdash;&#8220;O! eet ees a fonny
name. I nev-ver 'ear soch an-name-bef-fore. Deeek! eet ees
your non-sense.&#8221;</p>

<p>Milburd returns. He has shown the new guest to his room.
He will join us directly. He explains that sending in his card
&#8220;Baron Booteljak&#8221; is &#8220;his fun.&#8221; &#8220;Such an amusing chap,&#8221;
says Milburd; &#8220;he has cards of all sorts of names, printed to
leave on his friends, and puzzle 'em. He tells me that he's
brought down a box of practical jokes with him, all labelled,
numbered, and ready for use.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210">210</a></span>
This intelligence is not received with that warmth which
Milburd evidently had thought it would have elicited.</p>

<p><i class="first-word">ote.</i> Fifth week of our being here.</p>

<p>Very happy generally, Miss
Medford remarkably nice. Misses
Adelaide and Bella are always
out with Cazell, Milburd and
Chilvern. We've given Jenkyns
Soames several hints to go. He
won't.</p>

<p>If I wasn't President&mdash;I should like to&mdash;but Byrton's always
out with Miss Medford. I wonder that a girl with brains, as
she evidently has, can be taken by a fellow, who really seems to
think of nothing but riding, driving, and&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212">212</a></span>
&#8220;<i>Her</i>,&#8221; says Boodels, to whom I utter secretly my complaint.
I admit the truth of this. Boodels informs me that he's going
to be married. I congratulate him. When? When his house
is done up. Do I know the lady? Yes. Anyone here?&mdash;Ah,
he won't say, and begs me to consider this communication
strictly confidential.</p>

<p>Jimmy Layder is becoming a nuisance. He is perpetually
practically joking. Once and away it's very good fun&mdash;when he
performs on somebody else, not me. He comes down-stairs
quietly (this is one of his favourite tricks&mdash;so stupid, too!) and
slaps you on the back suddenly, immediately afterwards begging
your pardon, and explaining that he mistook you for somebody
else.</p>

<p>Then the second day he was here, he changed all the boots.
The third day I could not find a single thing in its place when
I went to dress in a hurry. On my complaining to him, he
pretends to be the Clown in the Pantomime (whom he emulates
in everything&mdash;and really, most dangerously, with a genuine
hot poker&mdash;so childish, and worse), and putting his hand on his
heart he declares &#8220;on his honour he didn't do it.&#8221; I know,
that, when I turn, he sets them all (Miss Medford, too) laughing
by making some grotesque face, and, if I face about suddenly,
he is staring at nothing on the ceiling, or pretending to catch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213">213</a></span>a fly. He puts oranges in boots, spoons and corkscrews in
people's pockets&mdash;generally mine&mdash;and has an irritating trick
of calling out &#8220;Hi!&#8221; and beckoning; then, when you come,
he asks you what you want?</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;To speak to him quietly, alone. He
listens. He owns that his exuberance of animal spirits often
leads him away. [Happy Thought.&mdash;Wish they'd take him away
altogether.] He says he thinks it's owing to the bracing
air; adding, that I take a joke so well, he is sure I shan't be
angry. I tell him that I don't speak <i>on my own account</i>,
but for the sake of others. He promises he will be quiet and
serious.</p>

<p>At night he keeps his word by coming down dressed like the
proverbial methodist Mawworm. An enormous white tie,
doubled. His hair combed sadly straight. A high black
waistcoat, his trousers shortened, white stockings and shoes.</p>

<p>They encourage him by laughing. He addresses everyone as
&#8220;My Christian Brother,&#8221; or &#8220;Sister,&#8221; and informs them that
the Head of the Establishment has requested him to be
serious.</p>

<p>He insists upon a serious evening, and tells us that Mr.
Jenkyns Soames has consented to give a Chemical Lecture
&#8220;with,&#8221; he adds impressively, &#8220;experiments.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214">214</a></span>
It appears that Layder and Milburd have undertaken to
assist the Professor.</p>

<p>After dinner, Layder announces that he has an entertainment
to commence with. He takes me on one side. We
go into the library, which he has prepared as a sort of dressing-room.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Humour him, and then he'll play practical
jokes on somebody else&mdash;not me.</p>

<p>He says, &#8220;Look here, you and I will dress up, and be the
lecturer's servants.&#8221; Very harmless and funny, seeing that the
dresses (which he has brought with him) are a mantle spangled,
two or three pairs of tights and Cavalier boots, and a cocked
hat. He says he's got a charade, and Milburd will dress up
too, and we'll have it before the Lecture.</p>

<p>He offers to do my face for me; and does it at once with
burnt cork, red and white.</p>

<p>Then he goes to dress.</p>

<p>I am alone. It is a good idea enlisting under, as it were, his
banner, then he won't annoy <i>me</i>. The fire's out here, and
changing my dress at this time has made me cold.</p>

<p><i>Meditations by myself when in a costume something between
a naval officer, a Spanish grandee, and Richard the Third.</i>&mdash;What
<i>can</i> be the fun of dressing up? It is so much more comfortable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215">215</a></span>in your own things. And a charade's a bore. At least, it
bores the audience, I'm sure. And if there are people acting
who say all sorts of nonsense, and do anything, there's no art in
it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Nine o'clock. I wish he'd brought a longer candle, and
would be quicker in dressing. He's gone to his own room, perhaps,
to dress, or is arranging the performance.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It's a
melancholy thing to be in these clothes. I wonder if they
were made for some great actor, or whether they were once the
real thing? No, that's impossible.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I wish Miss Medford
was going to take a part&mdash;perhaps she is.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unless that's her
touch on the piano. The overture probably.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It's so cold
in here, I must walk about.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The candle is burning down.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Ring and ask for another candle, and for
Mr. Layder.</p>

<p>Maid servant enters .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. gives a shriek and a start, and then&mdash;poor
girl!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. faints.</p>

<p>There is no water at hand.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>I don't like to touch her.</p>

<p>I've got an idea that people in that state bite, scratch, and
kick, if touched.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Let ill alone.</p>

<p>I ring violently.</p>

<p>Enter Butler. Fortunately Madame Regniati's maid passes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216">216</a></span>with salts. The girl recovers consciousness. She revives and
says I frightened her. I ask the butler to look for Mr. Layder.</p>

<p>Butler thinks they're all in the theatre-room hearing some
lecture. 10 o'clock.</p>

<p>I wait a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>It's too bad. I'll take these stupid things off.</p>

<p>Enter Boodels. &#8220;Hallo!&#8221; he cries. &#8220;What on earth are
you got up like this for?&#8221;</p>

<p>I say, testily, &#8220;I don't know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boodels continues. &#8220;Miss Cherton's maid 's been complaining,
and says you've been playing tricks on her. Come! <i>Do</i>
take off those things.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Do!</i> I don't want pressing. I have been for an hour and a
half dressed up here, with my face painted like a Red Indian,
and as cold as ice.</p>

<p>Layder enters. &#8220;Oh, my dear fellow, a thousand pardons. I
quite forgot you were here; and we suddenly&mdash;I mean the ladies,
suddenly altered the programme and wanted me to sing and do
some nonsense, so I could not refuse.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;(I'll vote against his invitation being
renewed after this week). Say nothing.</p>

<p>I find that Jenkyns Soames, induced to put on a sort of
Conjuror's dress, has been waiting to deliver his lecture the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217">217</a></span>same time that I have; he is equally cold, but not cross, as he
anticipates being a means of instruction to the party.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 232px;">
<img src="images/p0217-image.png" width="232" height="190" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Milburd and Layder have arranged the Professor's glass
bottles, glass jars, retorts, and all the other articles requisite for
a Chemical Lecture.</p>

<p>He informs us, that, owing to his friend Mr. Layder's kindness,
and to the accident of his having brought with him a few
chemicals, he (the Professor) will be enabled to give us an
amusing and instructive discourse.</p>

<p>&#8220;With experiments,&#8221; adds Layder gravely, from his seat.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Get as far away from the lecturer as
possible. Near the door.</p>

<p>The ladies being nervous, are re-assured by Milburd and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218">218</a></span>Layder, who say (in answer to Madame Regniati,) that, &#8220;there
is to be no firing,&#8221; and further, that &#8220;there is no experiment
on the table which can <i>hurt the audience</i>.&#8221; This latter observation
is added <i>sotto voce</i>, and is evidently not intended for
the Professor's ears.</p>

<p>Jenkyns Soames commences he says with Hydrogen. (<i>Hear!
hear!</i> from Milburd and Layder.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Hydrogen,&#8221; he goes on, &#8220;is a most powerful refractor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O my Jo!&#8221; exclaims the Signor in the front row, which he
evidently thinks is too near. &#8220;It vill go off, and 'urt some-bod-dy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Professor informs him, that Hydrogen mixed with
Atmospheric air, in the proportion of two to five, will explode;
but he does not mean to exhibit this peculiarity of Hydrogen.
He shows us how the lime-light is obtained, and requests that
the room may be darkened. Milburd and Layder, turn down
the gas, and remove the candles.</p>

<p>This is done too suddenly for the Professor, who has some
trouble in finding the right materials in the dark.</p>

<p>At last he has them. &#8220;I will now,&#8221; he says, &#8220;show you the
lime-light. A light of such steadiness and intensity, that it
appears to us quite blinding in its power.&#8221;</p>

<p>The immediate result is a fizz, a spark, and then we are in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219">219</a></span>total darkness once more. The Professor tries again, another
fizz, no spark.</p>

<p>Madame Regniati begs that the lights may be restored, and
asks him to try something else.</p>

<p>Apologising for the lime-light (I see Milburd and Layder
exchanging winks). The Professor passes on to Oxygen.</p>

<p>He shows us a jar of Oxygen. Experiments with an incandescent
piece of wood. (<i>Applause.</i>)</p>

<p>Another with phosphorus, and another with charcoal. (<i>Great
applause, and nothing having happened, we feel ourselves in
comparative safety. Madame observes, that she doesn't like
anybody playing with fire.</i>)</p>

<p>His next theme is &#8220;Inexplosive Gases.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Professor.</i>&mdash;I will now proceed to mix two colourless bodies
which, explosive in themselves, neutralize each other's qualities
on combination. You will observe that the same process is used
in pouring one gas out of one jar into another, as in pouring
water, and it is equally harmless. Here, for instance, is an
empty jar, and here is a glass jar full of water. I wish to pour
the water from the glass jar into the earthen one. (<i>Hear,
hear!</i> from Milburd.) I proceed to do so, and can assure you
that the experiment with the gases, is not more harmless and
simple than this, with the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220">220</a></span>
He pours the water out of the glass jar into the earthenware
one. In one second follows a series of sharp reports from
inside the jar, which seems suddenly to have become filled
with highly combustible crackers. The Professor drops the
jar as if he had burnt his fingers, and the cracking and
popping go on inside. Ladies rise frightened. Layder suddenly
addresses them:</p>

<p>&#8220;There's no sort of danger,&#8221; he says; &#8220;the jar won't burst.
I dropped an explosive pellet into it some time ago, and it
hasn't been taken out, that's all. The explosive pellets,&#8221; he
adds, modestly, &#8220;are my own invention, and chemically prepared,
only to burn in water.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cracking has ceased. Layder goes out, ostensibly to see
if he can procure another jar.</p>

<p>In his absence the ladies observe that the &#8216;cracking thing,&#8217;
whatever it was, has left a nasty smell in the room.</p>

<p>The Professor, with a smile, thinks that he can obviate this
unpleasantness. He has come across a fluid among the
chemicals labelled &#8220;<i>Parfum du Paradis</i>.&#8221; The direction
upon it is simply, &#8220;<i>Pour it out into a saucer, and everyone
will be delighted at the refreshing and delicious odour
which will instantaneously pervade even the largest apartment.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221">221</a></span>
The Professor, after uncorking and putting his nose to it,
pronounces his opinion that the liquid is inodorous, and must
have been kept too long in bottle.</p>

<p>&#8220;However,&#8221; says he, &#8220;I will follow the direction.&#8221;</p>

<p>Forthwith he pours it out.</p>

<span class="caption">&#8220;BUST UP.&#8221;</span>
</div>

<p>The next minute we are all cramming our handkerchiefs to
our faces, and making for
the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open the windows!&#8221;
cries Medford, in a fit of
coughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;O my&#8221;&mdash;cough&mdash;&#8220;Jo!&#8221;
exclaims the Signor.
&#8220;I shall be,&#8221;&mdash;cough and
sneeze, &#8220;so ill,&#8221;&mdash;cough,
&#8220;eet ees in my nose.&#8221;</p>

<p>As for the Professor,
being just over the horrible
compound, he has
nearly fainted.</p>

<p class="center" style="letter-spacing: 3em; margin-right: -3em;">*****</p>

<p>The room is cleared.</p>

<p>Servants sent to open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222">222</a></span>windows. Sneezing, coughing, and a suffocating, nauseating
sensation, experienced by everyone except Layder, who now
enters the drawing-room with a jar.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;To speak with an air of authority as
President, and tell him that it is really too bad of him to carry
such a liquid about. He exculpates himself by saying that the
Professor didn't know how to use it, and that he oughtn't to
have taken the things out of his Practical Joke Box.</p>

<p>&#8220;His <i>what</i> box?&#8221; we ask.</p>

<p>&#8220;My practical joke box,&#8221; he replies, quite calmly. &#8220;I've
got a box full of practical jokes in chemicals. They're very
amusing,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;if used properly.&#8221;</p>

<p>The horrid smell is gradually spreading itself throughout the
lower part of the house. It is stealing into the drawing-room,
it is getting into the morning-room, into the hall, into the
passages.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can't get rid of it,&#8221; Layder informs us, &#8220;for two or three
days. But it's first-rate for killing all insects.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is, we find, only one room in the house which the
nuisance has not reached. The smoking-room. Here we all
congregate. Everybody glum. Windows all over the place
open.</p>

<p class="center" style="letter-spacing: 4.5em; margin-right: -4.5em;">*****</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223">223</a></span>
Next morning.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Layder gone. Early.</p>

<p>He leaves us a note bequeathing us his box of Practical
Jokes, and a paper of &#8216;directions for use,&#8217; with &#8216;hints for
further practical jokes, being jottings for a manual with a
practical joke for every day in the year.&#8217;</p>

<p>In consequence of the draughts last night, everyone has caught
violent colds.</p>

<p>The Chertons won't leave their room. Madame Regniati
doesn't come down until dinner. Mr. and Mrs. Frimmely
pretend to have received a telegram, and say they must go
to-morrow. Miss Medford accompanies them; her brother stays.</p>

<p>The Signor suddenly remembers that he must proceed to his
leet-tel shoot-box at Bodge-bee.</p>

<p>Jenkyns Soames writes me a letter from his bedroom, commencing
&#8220;Sir,&#8221; and, considering himself insulted, leaves
without saying good-bye to anybody.</p>

<p class="center" style="letter-spacing: 4.5em; margin-right: -4.5em;">*****</p>

<p>Committee meeting. Complaints. Examination of accounts.
Row in consequence. Amount divided into shares. Chilvern
says he's sorry he's left his cheque-book in town.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Write it on a piece of paper or telegraph
for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224">224</a></span>
Chilvern genially says he's going up to town to-morrow, and
will get it then. Will I pay for him now?</p>

<p>Cazell says to me, &#8220;I tell you what you ought to do as President.
You ought to draw one cheque for the whole expenses,
and we'll pay you back. That's the most simple way of
doing it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Put to the vote and the plan carried, with a minority of one
(myself).</p>

<p class="center" style="letter-spacing: 4.5em; margin-right: -4.5em;">*****</p>

<p>The party gradually broken up. This evening Adelaide
Cherton and Madame appear with apologies for leaving us soon
after dinner. The smell not nearly evaporated. Byrton and
Milburd are gone to join the Signor for some sport. Medford
offers to show us his trick with a shilling, and Milburd, being
asked to sing, refuses. Boodels (who is melancholy, and in
love), asks Medford to play a tune, but Medford says he'd
rather not, because nobody will attend to his trick with a
shilling, whereupon Chilvern sits down to what he calls &#8220;try
something&#8221; on the piano. What he <i>does</i> try is our temper.
Gradually we leave the room and meet to smoke.</p>

<p class="center" style="letter-spacing: 4.5em; margin-right: -4.5em;">*****</p>

<p><i>Next Morning.</i> Violent cold.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Stay in bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225">225</a></span>
When I come down-stairs at one o'clock, I notice the desolate
appearance of the Hall. Hats, coats, rugs, sticks and whips, all
gone. Nothing lying about. Letters on table&mdash;&#8220;Sorry you
are not up&mdash;spent a very pleasant time, &amp;c.,&#8221; from Madame
and the Chertons, with whom have also departed Chilvern and
Cazell.</p>

<p>The only three in the house are Boodels, Medford, and
myself.</p>

<p>I say, genially, &#8220;Well, a little quiet will be pleasant.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boodels replies, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and adds that he's going off this
afternoon. I press him to stay. He won't, because, as he tells
me privately, that fellow Medford is so confoundedly insulting.
They've had a row.</p>

<p>Boodels <i>will</i> go. He promises to write to me about his
going to be married. At present I'm not to mention it. He
takes the butler and cook with him. He says he's very sorry
but he'll want them at home now.</p>

<p>The housemaid and charwoman officiate.</p>

<p>No other servants in the house.</p>

<p>Medford and I dine alone.</p>

<p>Somebody's taken the keys away by mistake, and we have
to break into the cellar to get out the wine. Very little
left.</p>

As host or president, I must stop and attend to Medford who
is our guest.</p>

<p>After dinner he says, &#8220;You heard me talking to Cazell about
the shilling and the glass.&#8221; I did. I know what's coming,
&#8220;It's a capital trick,&#8221; he goes on; &#8220;I'll show it you. Look
here.&#8221; He shows it me. I am not at all interested. He
offers to teach it me. Declined with thanks. He then explains
it to me.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Having done all this once, he'll never
try it again with me.</p>

<p>Getting comfortable in the smoking-room. We commence
talking over all our friends. The difficulty appears to consist
in finding any good qualities in them. Medford depreciates
everybody, specially if they can do anything in music or
theatricals. Getting more comfortable and confidential, I
tell Medford that Boodels is going to be married, but doesn't
want anyone to know it just yet. Medford says, &#8220;Pooh!
Boodels is an ass.&#8221; Subject dropped.</p>

<p><i>Last Morning.</i>&mdash;Charwoman and housemaid hearing that I
am going away with Medford, say they can't live alone in this
big place. They'd be frightened.</p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Opportunity to get rid of them. Do it.
Send for old woman and her husband to keep house while

agree, if not we shall sell or let</p>
